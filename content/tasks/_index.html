<p>You will get the most of out this class if you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>engage with the readings and materials,</li>
<li>use R to complete any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling" target="_blank">data wrangling</a> or analysis,</li>
<li>ask for help immediately after giving <strong>it</strong> (whatever it is) a good faith effort, and</li>
<li>keep an open and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a list of items considered to be class related tasks.</p>
<div id="project" class="section level2">
<h2>Project</h2>
<p>While I do not grade with a rubric, you can get an idea of what to address by using this.</p>
</div>
<div id="homeworks" class="section level2">
<h2>Homeworks</h2>
<p>On most weeks, you will be asked to submit a set of problems assigned after the prior week’s class. These must be submitted at the start of the next class unless otherwise noted.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Please adhere to the following format:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each item must be submitted on a separate page<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Show all work and do not assume any step.</li>
<li>Write neatly and leave plenty of space for comments. If you have difficulties in presenting neat work or in spacing, then use a computer program like Word. Again, if you learn how to type your homework in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Rmarkdown</a>, you will earn an extra 5% on each submission where this is done.</li>
</ol>
