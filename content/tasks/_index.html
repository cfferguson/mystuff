<p>You will get the most of out this class if you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>engage with the readings and materials,</li>
<li>use R to complete any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling" target="_blank">data wrangling</a> or analysis,</li>
<li>ask for help immediately after giving <strong>it</strong> (whatever it is) a good faith effort, and</li>
<li>keep an open and honest line of communication with me and your peers if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each type of assignment in this class helps with at least one one of these criteria.</p>
<div id="data-camp" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Camp</h2>
<p>Some class sessions have <a href="/datacamp/">interactive lessons</a> via <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Data Camp</a>. Your task is simply to go through these.</p>
<p>I will grade these short exercises using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>115% in gradebook</em>) Modules are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. These are not earned often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>100% in gradebook</em>) Modules are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct or on point. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>50% in gradebook</em>) Modules are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect or off-point. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise <em>0% in gradebook</em>.</p>

<div id="project" class="section level2">
<h2>Project</h2>
<p>While I do not grade with a rubric, you can get an idea of what to address by using this.</p>

<div id="homeworks" class="section level2">
<h2>Homeworks</h2>
<p>On most weeks, you will be asked to submit a set of problems assigned after the prior week’s class. These must be submitted at the start of the next class unless otherwise noted.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Please adhere to the following format:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each item must be submitted on a separate page<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Show all work and do not assume any step.</li>
<li>Write neatly and leave plenty of space for comments. If you have difficulties in presenting neat work or in spacing, then use a computer program like Word. Again, if you learn how to type your homework in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Rmarkdown</a>, you will earn an extra 5% on each submission where this is done.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Exam</h2>
<p>The final exam is scheduled for <strong>8 - 10 a.m. on Wednesday, December 15</strong>. Please do not be late as extra time will not be given.</p>
<hr />
<p>I always prefer face to face or at least conferencing if needed. With that said, we have Zoom and a <a href="https:/2021edp613.slack.com">Slack channel</a> so please use both!</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Should we move to an online format, homeworks must be submitted as a single document on the Submission Portal within <a href="https://ecampus.wvu.edu/" target="_blank">ecampus</a> as a single cohesive document (in either in docx or pdf format).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
