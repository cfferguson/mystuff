<li><p>First, the population is not clearly defined. Are the population subscribers to the newspaper? Readers of the newspaper? Or some other set of people? Even given this uncertainty, the letters to the editor would only be a random sample of a population if, clearly, they came randomly from that population. But there is no reason to assume this to be the case. People with stronger opinions, who can write reasonably well, and who have the time to write are more likely to write the editor. Since these characteristics are not distributed randomly throughout the adult population, it is improbable that the letters are a random sample.</p></li>

<li><p>This is a stratified sample because voters were first grouped by county, and unless the counties have the same number of voters, it is a disproportionate stratified sample because the same number is chosen from each county. We can assume that it was a probability sample, but we are not told exactly how the 50 voters were chosen from the lists. However, assuming that the population is defined as all Americans, this sort of sampling technique would qualify as nonprobability sampling.</p></li>
<li><p>This is neither a simple random sample nor a systematic random sample. It might be thought of as a sample stratified on last name, but even then, choosing the first 20 names is not a random selection process.</p></li>

<p>The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{Y}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is divided by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{Y}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}\)</span> must always be smaller than <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> barring the trivial case where <span class="math inline">\(N = 1\)</span>. Theoretically, the dispersion of the mean must be less than the dispersion of the raw scores.

<li><p>The standard error of the mean is<br><br>

<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{Y}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{1600}}=\frac{\sigma}{40}\)</span> for a sample size of 16000<br><br>

<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{Y}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{150}}\approx\frac{\sigma}{12.25}\)</span> for a sample size of 150<br><br>
We compare the two by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{17.32}{12.25} \approx 1.41\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{Y}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}\)</span> <span class="boxed">is greater by a factor of 1.41</span> when the sample size decreases from 300 to 150.</p></li>

<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{Y}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{4\cdot100}}=\frac{\sigma}{20}\)</span> for a sample size of 4000<br><br>

<li><p>Facebook Â® polls are most definitely not probability samples. While many reasons exists, the two noted below are likely the most important:
- the <em>population</em> from which data are gathered is limited to the <em>friends</em> on oneâs Facebook Â® profileâand such is certainly not a representative sample from the larger population.
- due to Facebook Â® algorithms, we canât be sure that every Facebook Â® friend would have the same opportunity to see, and thus participate, in the poll.</p></li>

<li><p>The population distribution is positively skewed and not close to normal. Since a very small sample size is used in this problem, the histogram for the samples of size 3 does not look normal. The distributions appear unimodal. The fact that the sample distribution of the means tends toward normality because of the Central Limit Theorem would become even more apparent if we took samples of size 5 or 6. To show this, look at the plots below

<li><p>This is not a reliable sample. The students eating lunch on Tuesday are not necessarily representative of all students at the school, and you have no way of calculating the probability of inclusion of any student. Many students might, for example, rarely eat lunch at the student union and, therefore, have no chance of being represented in your sample. The fact that you selected all the students eating lunch on Tuesday makes your selection appear to be a census of a population, but that isnât true either unless all the students ate at the student union on Tuesday.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not a reliable sample. The majority of people in attendance at the rally would probably be in support of open borders. Students against such might not have any chance of selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Answers will vary, but it seems the best route would be to obtain a list of all registered students from your universityâs registrar. And then employ a known sampling strategy (simple random sampling, stratified sampling, etc.) to create your sample of 10% of the student body. From there, you would reach out to each person youâve selected via e-mail, telephone, mail, and so on and ask them to complete your survey.</p></li>
