First things first:

<br>
<iframe src="/videos/snoop_syllabus.mp4" width="320" height="480" frameBorder="0">Read the syllabus.</iframe>

<br>Far be it from us to disagree with Snoop, so you should probably go read the [syllabus](/syllabus/) as soon as possible!

### Review Syllabus
Review the overviews of the other areas as well: [readings](/readings/), [data camp](/datacamp/), [materials](/materials/), [tasks](/tasks/), [to do list](/due/), and [resources](/resources/) pages for this class.

### Book Stuff
Read Chapter 1: *The What and the Why of Statistics* in Frankfort-Nachmias and Leon-Guerrero.
