<li><p>First, the population is not clearly defined. Are the population subscribers to the newspaper? Readers of the newspaper? Or some other set of people? Even given this uncertainty, the letters to the editor would only be a random sample of a population if, clearly, they came randomly from that population. But there is no reason to assume this to be the case. People with stronger opinions, who can write reasonably well, and who have the time to write are more likely to write the editor. Since these characteristics are not distributed randomly throughout the adult population, it is improbable that the letters are a random sample.</p></li>

<li><p>This is a stratified sample because voters were first grouped by county, and unless the counties have the same number of voters, it is a disproportionate stratified sample because the same number is chosen from each county. We can assume that it was a probability sample, but we are not told exactly how the 50 voters were chosen from the lists. However, assuming that the population is defined as all Americans, this sort of sampling technique would qualify as nonprobability sampling.</p></li>
<li><p>This is neither a simple random sample nor a systematic random sample. It might be thought of as a sample stratified on last name, but even then, choosing the first 20 names is not a random selection process.</p></li>

<p>The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{Y}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is divided by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\overline{Y}} =\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}\)</span> must always be smaller than <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> barring the trivial case where <span class="math inline">\(N = 1\)</span>. Theoretically, the dispersion of the mean must be less than the dispersion of the raw scores.

<li>Facebook ® polls are most definitely not probability samples. While many reasons exists, the two noted below are likely the most important:
<ul>
<li>the <em>population</em> from which data are gathered is limited to the <em>friends</em> on one’s Facebook ® profile–and such is certainly not a representative sample from the larger population.</li>
<li>due to Facebook ® algorithms, we can’t be sure that every Facebook ® friend would have the same opportunity to see, and thus participate, in the poll.</li>
