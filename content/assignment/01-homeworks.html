<li>Go to the course <a href="2020edp619.slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> account</li>
<li>Register if you already do not have an account. Note that you do not have to use your WVU account, but its not a bad idea.</li>
<li>Head to to the channel #introduce-yourself and well introduce yourself by tell everyone about yourself, what you hope to achieve out of this course, and something about you that really defines who you are. For example, here is something about me:<br>
<br>
<em>I teach data visualization BUT I am also about 40% colorblind! How do I know what color to use? Take EDP 693C: Data Visualization in the Spring to find out!</em> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><br><br></li>
<li>(optional) Provide a picture if you are willing. I am a very visual person as are many other people so pictures help a great deal. However, you are not mandated to do so!</li>

<p>At the nominal level, a simple measure of political participation is whether or not someone voted in the most recent general election. This variable would be coded either <span class="boxed">yes</span> or <span class="boxed">no</span>.</p>
<p>At the ordinal level, a composite measure could be constructed of both voting and political party membership, like this:</p>
<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left;">
Behavior
</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">
Code
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Didn’t vote; No membership
</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
0
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Voted; No membership OR Membership; Didn’t vote
</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
1
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Voted; Membership
</td>
<td style="text-align:center;">
2
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These codes are <span class="boxed">ordinal</span> in scale because the amount of political participation can be ranked from high to low. Other possible ordinal variables can be constructed from other sets of behaviors, such as working in a candidate’s campaign and signing a petition. The key points are to create a variable whose values can be ranked and whose values are not on an interval–ratio scale.</p>
<p>At the <span class="boxed">interval–ratio</span> level, political participation could be measured by the percentage of elections in which a person has voted since becoming eligible to vote, or the amount of money a person donated to political candidates during some specified time period.</p>
