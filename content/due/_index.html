<p>This section will let you know what must be completed for the purposes of assessment<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or preparation<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. You should still do everything else because those items are still expected and you will be scored on those skills eventually on some other course related task.</p>
