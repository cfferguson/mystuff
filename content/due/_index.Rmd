This section will let you know what must be completed for the purposes of assessment^[What you have to do after a current class ends.] or preparation^[What you have to do before the next class begins.]. You should still do everything else because those items are still expected and you will be scored on those skills eventually on some other course related task.

### Need Help?
I always prefer a face to face meeting if possible but since that's not possible, you can schedule a Zoom via the [Calendar](https://calendly.com/nopiecharts/short30){target="_blank"} or contact me within [Slack](http:/2021edp13.slack.com){target="_blank"} by tagging my name `@Dr. Abhik Roy` in a text box along with your message.
