### Data Camp
The fourth [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/){target="_blank"} module is due the Wednesday following the completion of the Week 4 class. The module covers doing basic descriptive statistics in R out of the box^[Mostly without any additional packages or what is known as Base R]. In particular, the sections are:

- Variables

As promised, we start performing basic statistical analyses in R.
