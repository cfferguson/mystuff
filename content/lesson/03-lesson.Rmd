### Data Camp
The third [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/){target="_blank"} module is due the  Wednesday following the completion of the Week 3 class. It covers a particular tidyverse package called `dplyr` which is by far the one of the most useful tools you can use. In particular the sections address:

- Transforming Data with dplyr
- Aggregating Data
- Selecting and Transforming Data
- Case Study: The babynames Dataset

This now sets us up to do meaningful statistics in R.
