These lessons are a central part of the class—they will teach you how to use R and corresponding packages we’ll use.\nInteractive training sections are provided on Data Camp1.\n    Purpose The ultimate point of Data Camp is to get you familiarized with an environment that you likely have never seen or been exposed to. While you should absolutely go through each module, there is certainly no expectation that you will get everything right. In fact, the points that you incur don’t mean anything as far as how you are assessed so please use hints as needed! As with any things data science, you’ll learn by doing. If you are a polar personality type when it comes to work (i.e. primarily a perfectionist or mostly careless), then the modules will likely prove to be a challenge. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to comprehend everything by going beyond your limit or that it will just come to you so please work hard but also take breaks, swear2, and ask peers or me for help.\n Grading The emphasis on Data Camp involves putting in a solid effort, rather than completing everything correctly. The earned grade distribution is as follows:\n 115%: Modules are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. These are not earned often. 100%: Modules are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct or on point. This is the expected level of performance. 50%: Modules are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect or off-point. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.  Otherwise 0%.\n Notes for previous participants If you have participated in Data Camp before and would like to receive credit for assigned modules you have previously completed, make sure to login with the associated username. Please note that you must do this to qualify.\n for new participants Please take your time going through these, especially the initial module. I suggest setting 8-10 hours aside spread the information out over the next two weeks if it is conducive to your learning style. This first module gives you an understand of the R environment. Please reach out if you need help!\n  Installing R and RStudio Go to the Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse page under Resources to get both R and RStudio installed on your system.\n Schedule A tentative schedule is given below.

It also allows you to ask questions prior to moving on! With that said, think of the text as a reference, in that\n it contains a lot of information that you may use but probably not right now, and it gives you a basis to ask intelligent questions.  So you should absolutely read it to get a basis but in the long run, you will learn more from this course by doing.\n The Course Nontext There’s no such thing as visual learner or any other kind of learner (Rogowsky, Calhoun \u0026amp; Tallal, 2015). With that said, reinforcement using different mediums such as presentations, videos, visualizations, walkthroughs, etc helps. These however take a lot of time to construct so please take some time to go through them. Is the production quality Hollywood? No because I’m a professor at a public university who doesn’t sound like Morgan Freeman, have three children and drive a car with duct tape on it BUT they’ll be decent.

Below is a list of items considered to be class related tasks.\nProject While I do not grade with a rubric, you can get an idea of what to address by using this.\n Homeworks On most weeks, you will be asked to create and completed an array of deliverable. These must be submitted at the start of the next class unless otherwise noted.1 Please adhere to the following format:\nEach item must be submitted on a separate page2. Show all work and do not assume any step. Write neatly and leave plenty of space for comments. If you have difficulties in presenting neat work or in spacing, then use a computer program like Word. Again, if you learn how to type your homework in Rmarkdown, you will earn an extra 5% on each submission where this is done.   Quizzes and Regular Exams Exact dates will be posted here soon but you will have an announced quizz or possibly two quizzes, two exams and a final.\n Final Exam This is a comprehensive exam covering content you have already been tested or quizzed on.

Unemployment records could be used to determine the actual number of unemployed; a descriptive statistic based upon the population. b. A survey is taken to estimate student opinions about the quality of food; inferential statistic. c. National health records can be used to determine the incidence rate of breast cancer among all Asian women, so this would be a descriptive statistic. d. The ratings will be gathered from a survey, so this is an inferential statistic. e. A university should be able to report GPA by major, so this is a descriptive statistic based upon the population. f. In theory, the United States records all immigrants to this country. Therefore, the number of South East Asian immigrants would be a descriptive statistic. However, because of illegal immigration, surveys are also taken to estimate the total number of legal and unauthorized immigrants. In that event, the number of immigrants would be an inferential statistic.  7  a. Annual income b. Gender: nominal\nNumber of hours worked per week: interval ratio\nYears of education: interval ratio\nJob title: nominal. c. This is an application of inferential statistics. The researcher is using information based on her sample to predict the annual income of a larger population of young graduates.  8  At the nominal level, a simple measure of political participation is whether or not someone voted in the most recent general election. This variable would be coded either yes or no. At the ordinal level, a composite measure could be constructed of both voting and political party membership, like this:   Behavior  Code      Didn’t vote; No membership  0    Voted; No membership OR Membership; Didn’t vote  1    Voted; Membership  2     These codes are ordinal in scale because the amount of political participation can be ranked from high to low. Other possible ordinal variables can be constructed from other sets of behaviors, such as working in a candidate’s campaign and signing a petition. The key points are to create a variable whose values can be ranked and whose values are not on an interval–ratio scale. At the interval–ratio level, political participation could be measured by the percentage of elections in which a person has voted since becoming eligible to vote, or the amount of money a person donated to political candidates during some specified time period.  --    You just need to know a little math to distinguish colors without ever seeing them↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cd68d33fd695c4cb530e5382816aaaff","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/01-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/01-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Class Slack Account Access Please sign up for Slack!","tags":null,"title":"The What and Why of Statistics","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      2  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  68-74      Notes: - Please submit this at the beginning of class next week. - Remember to follow the homework guidelines for consideration.\n Solutions Posted after class day and time next week.\n1  a.

People in this survey are more likely to have experienced no traumas last year (50% of the group). c. The proportion who experienced one or more traumas is calculated by first adding 36.7% and 13.3% equaling 50% and then divide that number by 100 to obtain the proportion, 0.50, or half the group.  4  Unfortunately since other visualizations have not been introduced, pie charts are likely the best method approach to present these data.  5  Yes because 79.2% had “hardly any” confidence in the press, compared to 19.3% of those who voted for Clinton.  6     E-mail Hours Per Week  Frequency  Cumulative Frequency  Percent  Cumulative Percent      0  19  19  19  19    1  20  39  20  39    2  13  52  13  52    3  5  57  5  57    4  2  59  2  59    5  6  65  6  65    6  5  70  5  70    7  2  72  2  72    8  3  75  3  75    9  1  76  1  76    10 or more  23  99  23  99    Total  99    99         7  According to this time series chart, rates of voting have consistently varied by race and Hispanic origin.

However, in 2016, the voting rates for Blacks declined to 59.6%--the lowest it has been since the 2000 election when it was 56.9%. Hispanic voting rates have, for the most part, remained stable, although with some fluctuation most notably from the 1992 election (51.6%) to the 1996 election (44%). As noted in the exercise, in the 2012 presidential election, Blacks had the highest voting rates for all groups, followed by non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic other races, and Hispanics. White voting rates increased by 1.2% from 2012 to 2016. The highest voting rate for Whites was in 1992 (70.2%), 1992 for Hispanics (51.6%), 2012 for Blacks (66.6%), and 1992 for non-Hispanic other races (54%).  --  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2e8bea3e53b754fadca5c81f6198bc0d","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/02-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/02-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      2  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  68-74      Notes: - Please submit this at the beginning of class next week.","tags":null,"title":"The Organization and Graphic Presentation of Data","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Textbook Notes In Class Notes R Walkthrough   Textbook Notes  Chapter 2 PowerPoint Chapter 2 Lecture Notes   In Class Notes  Download the class slides: Click on the presentation itself and then you may\n Move back and forth through the slideshow using the ⬅ and ⮕ buttons on your keyboard.

Based on the mode and median for this variable, most respondents indicate that their lives are Routine. d. A mean score is nonsense for nominal measurements.  2  a. The is ordinal. b. By using either figure related to the highest frequency or the highest percentage, the outcome is strongly agree. c. By using either related to the highest frequency or the highest percentage, the outcome is *strongly agree* for both years this indicating a high level of support. When combined *agree*, more than half of the 2014 (32.5% + 25.3% = 57.5%) and (39.5% + 27.0% = 66.5%) 2018 GSS samples agree that homosexuals should have the right to marry.  3  a. This has a level of an interval-ratio. Using frequencies^[You can also do this using cumulative percentages.], we have \\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{N+1}{2}\u0026= \\dfrac{32+1}{2}\\\\\\\\ \u0026= 16.5 \\end{aligned} Adding up the frequencies until locating the 16th and 17th cases yields the category 40 hr worked last week. b. We have - 25th percentile = $(32 × 0.25)$ implying the 8th case, or 30 hr worked last week. - 50th percentile is simply the median implying the category 40 hr worked last week. - 75th percentile = $(32 × 0.75)$ implying the 24th case, or 40 hr worked last week.  4  a. The mode category is agree. b. Using frequencies, we find that the median is 2, or agree. c. - 20th percentile = $(835 × 0.20)$ implying the 167th case, or strongly agree. - 80th percentile = $(835 × 0.80)$ implying the 668th case, or agree.  5  a.    Race  Mode  Median      Black  Seldom  Sometimes    Hispanic  Everyday  Nearly everyday    White  Everyday  Most days      b. Teens’ breakfast habits vary by race/ethnicity. Out of the three racial/ethnic groups, Black students were more likely to report seldom or sometimes eating breakfast. On the other hand, White and Hispanic students eat breakfast more frequently. The mode for White and Hispanic students is everyday.  6  The mode for both Males and Females is Working full-time. Using frequencies, we have - Males: \\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{N+1}{2}\u0026= \\dfrac{596+1}{2}\\\\\\\\ \u0026= 298.5 \\end{aligned} Adding up the frequencies until locating the 298th and 299th cases yields the category Working Full Time. - Females: \\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{N+1}{2}\u0026= \\dfrac{781+1}{2}\\\\\\\\ \u0026= 391 \\end{aligned} Adding up the frequencies until locating the 391th case yields the category Working Full Time. Using either the mode or median implies that there are no substantial differences between males and females.  10  a. \\   Hours Worked Last Week  Frequency  Hours Worked Last Week x Frequency      20  3  60    25  2  50    28  1  28    29  1  29    30  3  90    32  1  32    40  14  560    50  2  100    52  1  52    55  1  55    60  1  60    64  1  64    70  1  70    Total  32  1250     so we have \\begin{aligned} \\overline{Y}\u0026=\\dfrac{1250}{32}\\\\\\\\ \u0026\\approx 39.06 \\end{aligned} or about 39 hours. b. Since the median was 40 hr worked last week, the distribution is slightly skewed in a positive direction.  11  Since Clinton and Sanders’ middle-class income amount is higher than the U.S. Census estimated mean or median, their definition of middle class is not based on the statistical middle.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud Both R and RStudio are free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can use the free version of RStudio.cloud which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser with some limited capacity. However this means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R. Over the course of the semester, you may want to wean yourself off of the service and install both R and RStudio these things locally.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics.\nHere’s how you install R and RStudio locally\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac, Windows, or Linux:  If you use macOS\n scroll down to the .pkg file that corresponds to your architecture (Intel or ARM). As of this writing, the current version for each is is R-4.1.1.pkg, but please download the most current version.  Download and install XQuartz   If you use Windows\n click base (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.  Download and install Rtools    Double click on the downloaded files (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nDownload RStudio\n The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux, etc.) and will display a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n   Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on Install, type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on Install, type tidyverse, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"86f1654d0114d88986a69932d4d656ee","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/install/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/install/","section":"resources","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!","tags":null,"title":"Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   While there is no specific rubric, here is a basic outline of what to be looking out for in each task.

You can then use a converter program like pandoc to convert Markdown into whatever format you want: HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, etc. (see the full list of output types here)\nBasic Markdown formatting     Type… …or… …to get    Some text in a paragraph.

There are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here.\nYou can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n    Type… …to get    Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, or $\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$. Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or \\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).    To put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math: $$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ But now we just use computers to solve for $x$. …to get…\n The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nBut now we just use computers to solve for \\(x\\).\n Because dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\n Tables There are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say “hand-create” because it’s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like pander (use pandoc.table()) or knitr (use kable()). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. You should look at the full documentation here.\nFor simple tables, type…\n Right Left Center Default ------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1 Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Center Default    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1    For pipe tables, type…\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | |------:|:-----|---------|:------:| | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | | 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Default Center    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1     Footnotes There are two different ways to add footnotes (see here for complete documentation): regular and inline.\nRegular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like [^1], but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:\nType…\nHere is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags]. [^1]: This is a note. [^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat. And here\u0026#39;s more of the document. …to get…\n Here is a footnote reference1 and here is another.2\nAnd here’s more of the document.\n  This is a note.↩︎   DAGs are neat.↩︎     You can also use inline footnotes with ^[Text of the note goes here], which are often easier because you don’t need to worry about identifiers:\nType…\nCausal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!] …to get…\n Causal inference is neat.1\n  But it can be hard too!↩︎      Front matter You can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named YAML (or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) that follows this basic outline: setting: value for setting. Here’s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (---).\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; --- You can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My cool title: a subtitle\u0026quot; --- If you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n--- title: \u0026#39;An evaluation of \u0026quot;scare quotes\u0026quot;\u0026#39; ---  Citations One of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib --- Choose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib csl: \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\u0026quot; --- Some of the most common CSLs are:\n Chicago author-date Chicago note-bibliography Chicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids){target=\"_blank\"} APA 7th edition MLA 8th edition  Cite things in your document. Check the documentation for full details of how to do this. Essentially, you use @citationkey inside square brackets ([]):\n    Type… …to get…    Causal inference is neat [@Rohrer:2018; @AngristPischke:2015].

You can do everything you can with regular Markdown, but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even interactive dashboards with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and a package named blogdown).\nThe documentation for R Markdown is extremely comprehensive, and their tutorials and cheatsheets are excellent—rely on those.\nHere are the most important things you’ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\nKey terms  Document: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n Chunk: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n```{r} # Code goes here ``` There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n Knit: When you “knit” a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through pandoc to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you’ve selected).\nYou can knit by clicking on the “Knit” button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing ⌘⇧K on macOS or control + shift + K on Windows.\n   Add chunks There are three ways to insert chunks:\n Press ⌘⌥I on macOS or control + alt + I on Windows\n Click on the “Insert” button at the top of the editor window\n Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don’t do this)\n   Chunk names You can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they’ll appear in the list. If you don’t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won’t know what it does.\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the {r in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. All chunk names in your document must be unique.\n```{r name-of-this-chunk} # Code goes here ```  Chunk options There are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the RMarkdown Reference Guide or at knitr’s website.\nOptions go inside the {r} section of the chunk:\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} # Code goes here ``` The most common chunk options are these:\n fig.width=5 and fig.height=3 (or whatever number you want): Set the dimensions for figures echo=FALSE: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are message=FALSE: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted warning=FALSE: Any warnings that R generates are omitted include=FALSE: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document  You can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\n Inline chunks You can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `r r_code_here`.\nIt’s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE} avg_mpg \u0026lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg) ``` The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon. … would knit into this:\n The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n  Output formats You can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the YAML front matter.\ntitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; output: html_document: default pdf_document: default word_document: default You can also click on the down arrow on the “Knit” button to choose the output and generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the “Knit” button and choose “Output options”, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\nThe first output type listed under output: will be what is generated when you click on the “Knit” button or press the keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧K on macOS; control + shift + K on Windows). If you choose a different output with the “Knit” button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the output section.\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here’s what a typical output section might look like:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;My name\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;August 19, 2020\u0026quot; output: html_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 8 fig_width: 10 pdf_document: latex_engine: xelatex # More modern PDF typesetting engine toc: yes word_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 4 fig_width: 5 ---  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"34712881160d8448b3606651d889c270","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/rmarkdown/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/rmarkdown/","section":"resources","summary":"Key terms Add chunks Chunk names Chunk options Inline chunks Output formats   R Markdown is regular Markdown with R code and output sprinkled in.

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot; ) But you’ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there’s an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ⌘ + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It’s not always perfect, but it’s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\n Main style things to pay attention to for this class  Important note: I won’t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n Spacing  See the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10) Don’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” \u0026gt; “Global Options” \u0026gt; “Code” \u0026gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Comments  See the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n# Good #Bad #Bad If the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” \u0026gt; “Reflow comment”\n# Good # Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. # Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.

However, the first thing you may notice is that given Tableau is a proprietary software, there is severe lack of available free resources as opposed to R1. As opposed to open source softwares, you may have difficulties in locating resources that are not commercially linked and worth an investigation.\nSimilar to how Apple operates, Tableau’s parent company Salesforce tightly controls the ecosystem. However for those who want to avoid coding from the ground up, one of major benefits of the visualization software is that it plays well with R. However even with that capability, the interaction is narrowly defined. It also has the largest commercial footprint of those who prefer to pay for a graphical user interface when rendering data visualizations.\nIf you use Twitter, post Tableau-related questions and concerns using TableauSupport using @TableauSupport.

Response times are typically much quicker than the standard 24-48 hours given to emails. Please remember that life is somewhat chaotic at this time!\n  Course objectives Students will become proficient and be able to describe in detail the following aspects:\nAssessing and describing and scientific argumentation. Defining the underlying constructs for appropriate statistical techniques. Describing and graphing data. Explaining and drawing inferences from data. Gaining real world experience using R to analyze data sets. Obtaining an understanding of ethical, social, political, and cultural issues confronted by those who perform statistical analyses. Understanding and critically assessing differing analytical methods.   FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is R difficult? Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it’s akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!\n What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but unfortunately like everyone else, make silly mistakes including grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  Materials There are four optional texts and two software packages necessary for this course. With that said, you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.\nTexts We’ll rely on the texts below:\n Frankfort-Nachmias, C. and Leon-Guerrero, A. (2020). Social Statistical for a Diverse Society (9th ed.). Sage.1\n American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.).\n  There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\n Software R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\n R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the term, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Online Help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nBut there are multiple resources online to help.\n You will have access to Data Camp which allows you to relieve professional training that otherwise costs a lot of money. Is it perfect and flashy? Nope but it is interactive and if you pay attention, then R’s initial steep learning curve won’t feel like an uphill battle.\n Sites such as StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). I freely admit that StackOverflow has saved me multiple hours of frustration. Just note if you have a syntax or process issue, both sites require you to produce a minimally reproducible example.\n Use Twitter to post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally helpful.\n Searching for help with R on Google (or another indexed search site) can sometimes be tricky because the program name is,for a lack of a better explanation, a single letter.\n The class chatroom at Slack where you can poise a question. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. (This is a rare instances where I keep notifications on so please utilize it!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.\n Sixth and lastly you can send items by Slack or email me with questions about content, R or whatever (after giving a graduate student effort of course). Please include the subject header EDP 613 “the title of your email” where the title of your email is given without the quotes. Know that I will not just give you the answer, but am happy to push you in the right direction. If you do email me, please include the following:\n A brief description of the problem and what you have done thus far including the line number of the issue (if applicable). A copy of your data set (if applicable). A copy of your script or Rmarkdown document2 with comments throughout so I know what you’ve tried historically leading up to the issue.   I have a mail filter that will automatically bring your email to a top priority status.3\nYou should absolutely expect to struggle at times, but there is no better and more satisfying feeling than figuring things out for yourself! In the long run, you’re more likely to remember things you’ve figured out rather than those you’ve been shown or told.\n  Assignments and Grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the tasks page.\n   Percent  Task  Location      10  R Training  Data Camp    10  Exploratory Data Analysis  Project    10  Homeworks  Tasks    20  Quizzes  In Class    25  Regular Exams  In Class    25  FinalExam4  In Class      \n   Grade  Range      A  \u0026gt; 90%    B  80%-89%    C  70–79%    D  60–69%    F  \u0026lt; 60%      Rmarkdown If you submit your work in Rmarkdown, you may earn up to an extra five percent on any task (this includes quizzes and exams that aren’t focused on R). Additionally in lieu of showing step by step work, you may submit R code instead. In these instances, both the code used and output must be presented but you still must provide a written or typed interpretation in context.5\n   Your Hours Please watch this video:\n   Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!6). This means that I will be in my office or at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through either e-mail or Slack.\n Conduct and Expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the in-class tasks (e.g. exams, quizzes, etc.) and the project, past due deliverable will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.\n Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you — if that means commenting and answering questions - great; if it means sitting quietly and being focused - also great; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off - not so great.\n Justifications: On any submission, you must justify any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that not only is the Earth flat, the core is actually made out of tiramisu and moscato, the first question you should be asking is what’s your evidence? possibly followed by is the core delicious?.\n Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:\nWhen writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t often provided. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults7.\n My philosophy:\nJust assume that all submissions are formal and must be submitted with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. People who live in a land of rainbows and ponies by being easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless, or are generally unable to handle criticism should consider looking at another course. If you care about data, fieldwork, and learning a highly marketable skill set, then you’ve come to the right place. There is a great deal of content in this course and you will likely struggle with some at times. Given that, there is also something to be said about the satisfaction a person gets when figuring something out, but nowhere is it written that has to be on your own. You may find that a nudge here or there elicits the same feeling so please reach out for help.   Learning and knowledge during a pandemic When course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have learned. However learning is not the same as knowledge .\nTo save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans aren’t that good at evaluating a person’s knowledge mainly because its not a well-defined concept. With that said, we believe one indicator of knowledge is in a person’s ability to successfully explain a high level concept in such a way that the lay person can understand it. Every so often, consider asking yourself this:\nCan I describe whatever using conversational language so that a child could understand it?\n On top of what’s noted above and I’m not sure how to articulate this any better - life sucks right now! It is likely by now you know people who have been hospitalized or passed away, lost their jobs, and/or tested positive for COVID-19. Additionally stresses in life are up. Given this, here is my promise to you:\nIf you keep an open line, show initiative, and let me know ahead of time if something is going not according to plan8, I will do everything I can to help you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!\n   Course Policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.\n We will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\nCOVID-19 statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\n Psychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The office is staffed by professional counselors and psychiatrists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact them for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n CARE Team If you or anyone you know may be at-risk such as those listed here, please make a CARE referral. You may do so directly at the main WVU CARE TEAM site.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\n Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or the Campus Police at 304-293-3136.\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call/text a private Title IX On-Call Line 304-906-9930.\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at West Virginia University. WVU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims.\n Academic Integrity The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course. For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the West Virginia University Academic Catalog at http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter.\n Inclusivity Statement The West Virginia University community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion.\nIf you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with the Office of Accessibility Services (304-293-6700).\nFor more information on West Virginia University’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, please see http://diversity.wvu.edu.\n Incomplete Grades Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term. If the instructor agrees, the instructor and the student must negotiate the conditions under which the grade of I will be changed to a letter grade and sign a contract. The date to submit the incomplete work should not be set beyond the last day of class of the following semester. If the student does not complete the terms of contract, then the instructor should submit a grade of F. All incomplete contracts must be filed with the department and Dean’s Office. See the policy at [Students who want to be considered for an Incomplete must apply to their instructor prior to the end of the term.

Please review the sharing and editing restrictions prior to distributing or amending any material on this site. As such, the unauthorized purchase or sale of these materials may result in disciplinary sanctions under the Campus Student Code. Basically you can share what you like but don’t try to make a buck.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.  Be aware of the University’s Academic Integrity and Dishonesty Policy http://catalog.wvu.edu/undergraduate/coursecreditstermsclassification/#academicintegritytext. You can review the rules, regulations, and procedures concerning student conduct and discipline for the main campus of West Virginia University, at http://campuslife.wvu.edu/r/download/1802350.\n Response Time I generally respond to Slack queries in the same day while responses to emails and discussion posts are within 48 hours, except during holidays. Often, I will reply much more quickly but you should not count on a immediate. Please plan accordingly so that you don’t miss deadlines! I generally return assignments within one to two weeks after a final submission date.\n Technical Requirements Students need to have access to a computer for word processing, e-mail and access to eCampus.

When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.\nUnzipping files on macOS Double click on the downloaded .zip file. macOS will automatically create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, and all the file’s contents will be inside. Double click on the RStudio Project file (.Rproj) to get started.\n Unzipping files on Windows tl;dr: Right click on the .zip file, select “Extract All…”, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.\nUnlike macOS, Windows does not automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file. Open the R Project file and RStudio will point to the correct working directory and everything will work.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6f4ecdc3d11db9e24e62ab87ff9e614d","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/unzipping/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/unzipping/","section":"resources","summary":"Because RStudio projects typically consist of multiple files (R scripts, datasets, graphical output, etc.) the easiest way to distribute them to you for examples, assignments, and projects is to combine all the different files in to a single compressed collection called a zip file.","tags":null,"title":"Unzipping files","type":"docs"}]
