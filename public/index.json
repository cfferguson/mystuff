These lessons are a central part of the class—they will teach you how to use R and corresponding packages we’ll use.\nInteractive training sections are provided on Data Camp1.\n    Purpose The ultimate point of Data Camp is to get you familiarized with an environment that you likely have never seen or been exposed to. While you should absolutely go through each module, there is certainly no expectation that you will get everything right. In fact, the points that you incur don’t mean anything as far as how you are assessed so please use hints as needed! As with any things data science, you’ll learn by doing. If you are a polar personality type when it comes to work (i.e. primarily a perfectionist or mostly careless), then the modules will likely prove to be a challenge. It is highly unlikely that you will be able to comprehend everything by going beyond your limit or that it will just come to you so please work hard but also take breaks, swear2, and ask peers or me for help.\n Grading The emphasis on Data Camp involves putting in a solid effort, rather than completing everything correctly. The earned grade distribution is as follows:\n 115%: Modules are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. These are not earned often. 100%: Modules are 70–99% complete and most answers are correct or on point. This is the expected level of performance. 50%: Modules are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect or off-point. This indicates that you need to improve next time. Hopefully people will not earn this often.  Otherwise 0%.\n Notes for previous participants If you have participated in Data Camp before and would like to receive credit for assigned modules you have previously completed, make sure to login with the associated username. Please note that you must do this to qualify.\n for new participants Please take your time going through these, especially the initial module. I suggest setting 8-10 hours aside spread the information out over the next two weeks if it is conducive to your learning style. This first module gives you an understand of the R environment. Please reach out if you need help!\n  Installing R and RStudio Go to the Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse page under Resources to get both R and RStudio installed on your system.\n Schedule A tentative schedule is given below.

It also allows you to ask questions prior to moving on! With that said, think of the text as a reference, in that\n it contains a lot of information that you may use but probably not right now, and it gives you a basis to ask intelligent questions.  So you should absolutely read it to get a basis but in the long run, you will learn more from this course by doing.\n The Course Nontext There’s no such thing as visual learner or any other kind of learner (Rogowsky, Calhoun \u0026amp; Tallal, 2015). With that said, reinforcement using different mediums such as presentations, videos, visualizations, walkthroughs, etc helps. These however take a lot of time to construct so please take some time to go through them. Is the production quality Hollywood? No because I’m a professor at a public university who doesn’t sound like Morgan Freeman, have three children and drive a car with duct tape on it BUT they’ll be decent.

Below is a list of items considered to be class related tasks.\nProject While I do not grade with a rubric, you can get an idea of what to address by using this.\n Homeworks On most weeks, you will be asked to create and completed an array of deliverable. These must be submitted at the start of the next class unless otherwise noted.1 Please adhere to the following format:\nEach item must be submitted on a separate page2 and written in pencil. Show all work and do not assume any step. Write neatly and leave plenty of space for comments. If you have difficulties in presenting neat work or in spacing, then use a computer program like Word. Again, if you learn how to type your homework in Rmarkdown, you will earn an extra 5% on each submission where this is done. Staple all of your pages together.   Quizzes and Regular Exams Exact dates will be posted here soon but you will have an announced quiz or possibly two quizzes, two exams and a final.\n Final Exam This is a comprehensive exam covering content you have already been tested or quizzed on.

Veritasium + Crash Course Statistics This week we’re doing something a little different. We first have a video from a science communicator named Derek Muller on his excellent YouTube channel Veritasium. At the end, there will be two videos from Crash Course Statistics that go deeper into the statistics part of the Bayesian approach.\n  Note To be honest most of you will leave this class likely not thinking or caring about the underlying methodological and philosophical disagreement that exists between the two types of statisticians explained below. So why does it matter? In a nutshell, we’re at a point in history where the dominant approach will affect your everyday life ranging from credit to Internet speeds to predictions/reviews in sports to any other aspect where data, in particular “big data” is present. So while you may not be personally invested in the statistical approach that becomes the standard, your life will surely be affected and its not a bad idea to know the underlying reasons behind it.\n   Full Disclosure Firstly I am a Bayesian statistician through and through, so there is an inherent bias and uncertainty in this writing which will be apparent later. The benefit here is that unlike a frequentist approach that rejects or minimizes bias and favors outcomes with certainty, Bayesians recognize and utilize bias in their statistics where both uncertainty exists as part of the problem, and solutions are given as multiple possibilities with varying levels of probabilities1.\n  The Bayesian way of thinking was quite popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, but fell out of favor in the 20th century which gave way to the frequentists. During that time, the few Bayesian statisticians that were active were often shunned and even ridiculed by academics and practitioners alike. It looked like we knew everything about the foundation of statistics and anything that needed a new approach was simply a matter of furthering that viewpoint. But in the mid to late 2000 large sets consisting of a combination of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data - aka “big data” - began to pop up everywhere. However technology, in particular computing technology was simply not able to handle and analyze these data sets. Moreover for most of the public, computers were just a means to create or run an application - the idea that they could do anything beyond that was deemed to be science fiction that could be science one day in the distant future. But as life would have it, not only were we able to figure out how to teach a computer to learn and make decisions - aka machine learning (ML) - many ML algorithms were significant improved by attaching prior beliefs about how a data set should be looked at creating a situation where a person get choice of multiple statistical models and are able to pick the one that works out the best for an analyses.\n A Line is Drawn Statisticians and those who practice statistics are at odds on how the world works. One group - the frequentists - think deductively and see probability as a means for finding a single defined outcome while another - the Bayesians - think inductively and use probability to describe the chance of many possible outcomes.\nFrequentist Statisticians Statisticians who view the world as deterministic, do not include subjectivity, and see probabilities as a way to explain how random events would look after a bunch of trials are known as frequentist statisticians. To show this through a statistical lens, let’s look at the traditional coin flipping example: As a frequentist statistician, we would\nfirst suppress any prior ideas of how the outcome should look; then flip a coin over and over and record the results; and find that after enough flips that while we will likely never get 50-50 odds, the data shows that we’re heading that way so with the idea if we flipped that coin an infinite number of times, that’s the true outcome.  This is the idea of something being deterministic where probabilities are used to describe a fixed value which in this case is always going to be 50-50. For any social scientists, the epistemological perspective is that frequentist for the most part believe in a single truth.\n Bayesian Statisticians Statisticians who view the world as probabilistic, allow for prior beliefs about a phenomena, and update the probability of those beliefs with new evidence are known as Bayesian statisticians. To again show this through a statistical lens, let’s look at the traditional coin flipping example: As a Bayesian statistician, we would\nfirst have a prior belief of what the probability of getting a heads or tails is say 50-50. then flip a coin over and over and record the results; and find that after enough flips that we will never get to the 50-50 odds implying that there are multiple possible outcomes, each with its own associated probability.  This is the idea of something being deterministic where probabilities are used to describe multiple values which in this case may be 50-50, but could also be 40-60, 60-40, 20 - 80 and so on, each associated with some chance of being true. For any social scientists, the epistemological perspective is that Bayesian for the most part believe in multiple truths with some more likely than others.\n  A Mostly Non Stats Example Rather than provide an example that uses a bunch of statistics, let’s look at it practically.\nSituation: You have misplaced your iPhone somewhere in your apartment or home. You can use the Find My app ® to find it and hear beeping.\nProblem: Which room in your apartment or home should you search?\nApproaches\n Frequentist: You hear the phone beeping and you have some approach using a mental model to help figure out what room the beeping is coming from. So you used inferences from the beeps to locate the room in your home you must search to find the phone.\n Bayesian: You hear the phone beeping and along with some approach using a mental model, you also know all of the rooms you have misplaced the phone before which combined help to figure out what room the beeping is coming from. So you used inferences from the beeps and prior knowledge  to locate the room in your home you must search to find the phone.\n   A Table of Differences There are multiple differences in how the sides view not just how problems should be viewed and solved, but on the nature of reality itself. The table below gives some overarching ones.\n  Type  Information Used  What is Random?  Type of Reasoning  Terminology  Observed Data      Frequentist statistician  Outcomes derived strictly from experiments  Observed data2  Deductive logic.  Common terms like p-value, significant, null hypothesis, and confidence interval.  Unknown and comes only from experiments.    Bayesian statistician  Prior beliefs about what the truth might be which are updated as experiments progress.  Population parameters3  Inductive logic.  Uncommon terms like prior probability, noninformative priors, and credible intervals.  Known since we already know what we know.      So Who is Right? We honestly just don’t know right now. Similar to physics where there are two seemingly incompatible laws governing the universe - relativity for large and quantum for small objects, respectively - statisticians have the same difficulty regarding inferences. The frequentist thinking is by far the dominant approach because it involves fairly “simple” and concrete calculations that can be tested and verified when explaining the phenomena around us. In fact, the approach aligns with the idea of certainty that humans like and need to make sense of the world, but there is a limit to what this approach can explain and that has not been more apparent than with computing. Practically speaking ignoring the human element in a study absolutely makes it easier to perform analyses, but the very act of removing it has an affect from start to finish that results in outcomes that are at the very least imprecise and at most harmful.\nThe actual explanation for which side is right is likely some combination of both approaches - yet there may also be another method that can unify both into an all encompassing statistical approach that we just haven’t considered yet or maybe both approaches are wrong and we need to rethink statistics from the ground up. For now all we have are these two somewhat related yet also contradictory views on how the world works.\nSo it may be that frequentist statistics is a needed field in order to get to the Bayesian way of looking at the world similar to needing an understanding of descriptive statistics prior to moving into inferential.\nFrequentist Statistics  \n Bayesian Statistics     Fun fact: The fact you are able to view this exact page right now is based on based on probability↩︎\n Any data that has been collected from an experiment.↩︎\n Any summary number, like an average or percentage, that describes the entire population.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3144575b3be5c5a4eafe0634bcaaa156","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/materials/14-example/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/materials/14-example/","section":"materials","summary":"Veritasium + Crash Course Statistics Note Full Disclosure  A Line is Drawn A Mostly Non Stats Example A Table of Differences So Who is Right?

Remember to follow the homework guidelines for consideration.   Solutions Note: To stay consistent with the general literature, the \\(\\chi^2\\) value obtained will be referenced by the variable \\(\\chi^2_{obt}\\).\n  1   The independent variable is sex while the dependent variable is fear of walking alone at night.\n  Choice  Male  Female      Yes  2 (22%)  8 (73%)    No  7 (78%)  3 (27%)       Approximately \\(73\\)% of women are afraid to walk alone in their neighborhoods at night, whereas approximately \\(22\\)% of men said the same. This amounts to about a \\(51\\)% difference between women and men who are not afraid to walk alone at night, indicating a strong relationship. It is important to keep in mind that our small sample size limits the generalizability of these results.\n There does not appear to be much of a relationship between homeownership and fear of walking alone at night. The majority in both homeownership categories (\\(54\\)% and \\(55\\)%) indicated that they were not afraid of walking alone at night in their neighborhood.\n  Response  Male  Female      Yes  4 (44%)  5 (45%)    No  5 (54%)  6 (55%)           2   The the independent variable is AGE independent variable and measured in categories.\n The independent variable AGE is ordinal while the dependent variable PRES16 is nominal.\n There appears to be a relationship between age and who a respondent voted for in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Of those surveyed, \\(55.4\\)% voted for Clinton, whereas only \\(35.4\\)% voted for Trump. However, far more younger people voted for Clinton than Trump. Take for example the categories 18–29 and 30–39. Of those 18–29 years of age, \\(65.7\\)% voted for Clinton as compared to \\(19.2\\)% of those of the same age group that voted for Trump (\\(19.2\\)%). Similarly, \\(61.1\\)% of those between 30 and 39 voted for Clinton, whereas only \\(26.8\\)% of the same age group voted for Trump.\n      3   Based on the student’s argument, the independent variable is race and the dependent variable is home ownership.\n We have \\[\\dfrac{539}{857} \\approx 0.6289\\] or about \\(63\\)%.\n There appears to be a relationship between race and home ownership. While \\(63\\)% of those surveyed report owning a home, far less Black respondents report such (\\(41.3\\)%) than White respondents (\\(67.7\\)%). Furthermore, \\(58.7\\)% of Black respondents rent as compared to \\(32.3\\)% of White respondents.\n      4   The independent variable is the respondent’s age while the dependent variable is home ownership.\n Yes, there appears to be a relationship between age and home ownership. While \\(51\\)% of all those surveyed are home owners, a far greater percentage of those 50–59 years-of-age are home owners (\\(65.7\\)%) than all other age categories, especially those between 18 and 29 years-of-age.\n Possible answers: student loan debt - a person might not be able to save up for a down payment - and city of residence - home ownership in San Francisco or New York City is impossible for many people due to home values.\n       5   There appears to be a relationship between race and the frequency of being drunk in the last 12 months. The majority of students (\\(60\\)%) are likely to report not being drunk in the last 12 months. However, the percentage of students being drunk at least 3 or more times is highest for Whites (\\(28\\)%), followed by Hispanic (\\(16\\)%) and Black (\\(11\\)%) students.\n  Frequency  Black  White  Hispanic  Total      None  359 (75%)  1081 (55%)  480 (67%)  1920 (60%)    1-2 times  63 (13%)  342 (17%)  125 (17%)  530 (17%)    3-5 times  24 (5%)  168 (8%)  50 (7%)  242 (8%)    \u0026gt; 6 times  31 (6%)  389 (20%)  64 (9%)  484 (15%)    Total  477 (99%)  1980 (100%)  719 (100%)  3176 (100%)         ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"448d5e6051f8382eff8dd41f93d888ee","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/10-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/10-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      9  1, 2, 3, 4, 5  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  237-240      Notes:","tags":null,"title":"Bivariate Tables","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"     Textbook Notes In Class Notes R Walkthrough    function resizeIframe(obj) { obj.style.height = obj.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }   .hvr-sweep-to-left { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; -webkit-transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); position: relative; -webkit-transition-property: color; transition-property: color; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.25s; transition-duration: 0.25s; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:before { content: \"\"; position: absolute; z-index: -1; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: #761756; -webkit-transform: scaleX(0); transform: scaleX(0); -webkit-transform-origin: 100% 50%; transform-origin: 100% 50%; -webkit-transition-property: transform; transition-property: transform; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.3s; transition-duration: 0.3s; -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease-out; transition-timing-function: ease-out; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:hover, .hvr-sweep-to-left:focus, .hvr-sweep-to-left:active { color: white; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:hover:before, .hvr-sweep-to-left:focus:before, .hvr-sweep-to-left:active:before { -webkit-transform: scaleX(1); transform: scaleX(1); }  Textbook Notes         Chapter 10 PowerPoint  Chapter 10 Notes            In Class Notes  You can move back and forth using ← and → and toggle fullscreen by pressing F.

Remember to follow the homework guidelines for consideration.   Solutions 1  a. We have \\begin{align} df \u0026= (3-1)\\cdot(2-1)\\\\ \u0026= 2 \\end{align} yielding 2 degrees of freedom. b. We have $\\chi^2 = 3.311$. With $\\chi^2_{obt} = 0.191  \\alpha = 0.01$, we fail to reject $H_0$ and conclude that sex and opinion of whether or not people can be trusted are likely independent. Specifically, similar percentages of men ($34.94$%) and women ($29.7$%) felt that people can be trusted. c. If $\\alpha = 0.05$, $\\chi^2_{obt} = 0.191$ would still be greater and thus we would still reject $H_0$. d. We have $\\lambda = 0.000$ implying that there is no proportional reduction of error using sex to predict whether or not people can be trusted.  2  a. There does not appear to be a relationship between gender and views on restoring the voting rights of felons in prison. $30$% of respondents supported restoring the voting rights of felons in prison, with only a slightly greater percentage of men ($31$%) reporting such compared to women ($28$%).   Restoring Voting Rights  Men  Women  Total      Support  31%  28%  30%    Oppose  69%  71%  70%    Total  100%  99%  100%       b. We fail to reject $H_0$ of no relationship and conclude that there is not a relationship between gender and views on restoring the voting rights of felons in prison at the $0.05$ $\\alpha$ level.  3  a. A higher percentage of White respondents ($38.14$%), compared to Black respondents ($23$%), reported that people could be trusted. b. For Black respondents, a slightly higher percentage of men ($15.1$%) compared to women ($12.5$%) reported that people could be trusted. c. For - Whites with $\\chi^2 = 2.395$, we fail to reject $H_0$. - Blacks with $\\chi^2 = 0.233$, we fail to reject $H_0$. It is also worth noting that two of the cells have expected counts less than 5 so results should be cautiously interpreted. It would likely be beneficial to repeat the study with a larger sample size.  5  a. We will make 2,973 errors since we predict that all victims fall in the modal category (White) where \\begin{align} E_1 \u0026= 6084 – 3111\\\\ \u0026= 2973 \\end{align} b. For - White offenders, we could make 373 errors - Black offenders, we could make 493 errors - Other offenders, we would make 42 errors given $E_2 = 908$. c. The proportional reduction in error is then \\begin{align} \\dfrac{2973 – 908}{2973} \u0026 \\approx 0.6946 \\end{align} This indicates a very strong relationship between the two variables. We can reduce the error in predicting victim’s race based upon race of offender by 69.46%.  7  We have    Race/Status  $f_0$  $f_e$  $f_0-f_e$  $(f_0-f_e)^2$  $\\dfrac{(f_0-f_e)^2}{f_e}$      White/First-Generation  1742  1749.6  -7.6  57.76  0.03    White/Nonfirst-Generation  2392  2384.4  7.6  57.76  0.02    Black/First-Generation  102  93.5  8.5  72.25  0.77    Black/Nonfirst-Generation  119  127.5  -8.5  72.25  0.57    Native American/First-Generation  41  36.4  4.6  21.16  0.58    Native American/Nonfirst-Generation  45  49.6  -4.6  21.16  0.43    Hispanic/First-Generation  19  18.6  0.4  0.16  0.01    Hispanic/Nonfirst-Generation  25  25.4  -0.4  0.16  0.01    Asian American/First-Generation  6  11.9  -5.9  34.81  2.93    Asian American/Nonfirst-Generation  22  16.1  5.9  34.81  2.16    $\\chi^2 = 7.51$            So $\\chi^2 = 7.51$ with $df = (2-1)\\cdot(5-1) = 4$ implying we would fail to reject $H_0$.

So we reject $H_0$ and can likely assume there is a significant difference in the proportion of homeowners between first-generation and second-generation Hispanic Americans. In fact given we have $0.43-0.50=-0.07$, there is a lower proportion of home ownership among first-generation Hispanic Americans than second-generation Hispanic Americans. b.

So we reject $H_0$ and can likely assume there is a significant difference in the proportion of homeowners between first-generation and second-generation Asian Americans.

We have \\begin{align} H_0:\\,\\pi_1=\\pi_2\\\\ H_1:\\,\\pi_1$z_{obt}=-3.50 (and less than $0.0002$ from Appendix A). So the proportion of White respondents who support the tactic of bringing people of different racial backgrounds together to talk about race is lower than the proportion of Black respondents. The difference given by $0.41-0.34$ is likely significant at the $0.05$ level.  5  a. We have \\begin{align} H_0:\\,\\mu = 37.8\\\\ H_1:\\,\\mu\\neq 37.8 \\end{align} b.

We can say that $H_0$ should likely be rejected in favor of the $H_1$. So there is a difference between the mean age of the GSS sample and the mean age of all American adults. Relative to age, the GSS sample is not representative of all American adults (the GSS sample is significantly older).  --  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e4d5fa7cb5dd21f63ca20e552153d72a","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/13-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/13-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      11  1, 2, 6  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  394-400    12  1, 2  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  446-458      Notes:","tags":null,"title":"Regression and Correlation \u0026 Analysis of Variance","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    Textbook Notes In Class Notes    function resizeIframe(obj) { obj.style.height = obj.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }   .hvr-sweep-to-left { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; -webkit-transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); position: relative; -webkit-transition-property: color; transition-property: color; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.25s; transition-duration: 0.25s; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:before { content: \"\"; position: absolute; z-index: -1; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: #761756; -webkit-transform: scaleX(0); transform: scaleX(0); -webkit-transform-origin: 100% 50%; transform-origin: 100% 50%; -webkit-transition-property: transform; transition-property: transform; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.3s; transition-duration: 0.3s; -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease-out; transition-timing-function: ease-out; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:hover, .hvr-sweep-to-left:focus, .hvr-sweep-to-left:active { color: white; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:hover:before, .hvr-sweep-to-left:focus:before, .hvr-sweep-to-left:active:before { -webkit-transform: scaleX(1); transform: scaleX(1); }  Textbook Notes         Chapter 1 PowerPoint  Chapter 1 Notes            In Class Notes  You can move back and forth using ← and → and toggle fullscreen by pressing F.

A survey is taken to estimate student opinions about the quality of food; inferential statistic. National health records can be used to determine the incidence rate of breast cancer among all Asian women, so this would be a descriptive statistic. The ratings will be gathered from a survey, so this is an inferential statistic. A university should be able to report GPA by major, so this is a descriptive statistic based upon the population. In theory, the United States records all immigrants to this country. Therefore, the number of South East Asian immigrants would be a descriptive statistic. However, because of illegal immigration, surveys are also taken to estimate the total number of legal and unauthorized immigrants. In that event, the number of immigrants would be an inferential statistic.     7   Annual income Gender: nominal\nNumber of hours worked per week: interval ratio\nYears of education: interval ratio\nJob title: nominal. This is an application of inferential statistics. The researcher is using information based on her sample to predict the annual income of a larger population of young graduates.     8   At the nominal level, a simple measure of political participation is whether or not someone voted in the most recent general election. This variable would be coded either yes or no.\nAt the ordinal level, a composite measure could be constructed of both voting and political party membership, like this:\n  Behavior  Code      Didn’t vote; No membership  0    Voted; No membership OR Membership; Didn’t vote  1    Voted; Membership  2     These codes are ordinal in scale because the amount of political participation can be ranked from high to low. Other possible ordinal variables can be constructed from other sets of behaviors, such as working in a candidate’s campaign and signing a petition. The key points are to create a variable whose values can be ranked and whose values are not on an interval–ratio scale.\nAt the interval–ratio level, political participation could be measured by the percentage of elections in which a person has voted since becoming eligible to vote, or the amount of money a person donated to political candidates during some specified time period.\n    You just need to know a little math to distinguish colors without ever seeing them↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cd68d33fd695c4cb530e5382816aaaff","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/01-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/01-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Class Slack Account Access Please sign up for Slack!","tags":null,"title":"The What and Why of Statistics","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      2  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  68-74      Notes: - Please submit this at the beginning of class next week. - Remember to follow the homework guidelines for consideration.\n Solutions   1   Race is a nominal. variable; Since categories can be ordered, Class is an ordinal variable; Trauma is an interval variable.\n Frequency table for Race:\n     Race  Frequency      White  17    Non-White  13    Total  30      We have     Classification  Proportion      White  17/30 = 0.57    Non-White  13/30 = 0.43    Total  30/30 = 1.00         2   Frequency and Percentage Distribution Table for Class:\n   Class  Frequency  Percent      Lower  3  10    Working  15  50    Middle  11  36.7    Upper  1  3.3    Total  30  100      The smallest perceived class group is the upper class, making up only 3.3% of the survey.\n Together, the working and middle class make up 50% + 36.7% = 86.7% of the survey.\n     3   Frequency table for Traumas:\n   Number of Traumas  Frequency      0  15    1  11    2  4    Total  30      Trauma is an interval- or ratio-level variable, since it has a real zero point and a meaningful numeric scale.\n People in this survey are more likely to have experienced no traumas last year (50% of the group).\n The proportion who experienced one or more traumas is calculated by first adding 36.7% and 13.3% equaling 50% and then divide that number by 100 to obtain the proportion, 0.50, or half the group.\n     4   Unfortunately since other visualizations have not been introduced, pie charts are likely the best method approach to present these data.\n   5   Yes because 79.2% had “hardly any” confidence in the press, compared to 19.3% of those who voted for Clinton.\n   6      E-mail Hours Per Week  Frequency  Cumulative Frequency  Percent  Cumulative Percent      0  19  19  19  19    1  20  39  20  39    2  13  52  13  52    3  5  57  5  57    4  2  59  2  59    5  6  65  6  65    6  5  70  5  70    7  2  72  2  72    8  3  75  3  75    9  1  76  1  76    10 or more  23  99  23  99    Total  99    99           7   According to this time series chart, rates of voting have consistently varied by race and Hispanic origin.

Remember to follow the homework guidelines for consideration.   Solutions   1   The mode is Routine.\n The median is Routine.\n Based on the mode and median for this variable, most respondents indicate that their lives are Routine.\n A mean score is nonsense for nominal measurements.\n     2   The is ordinal.\n By using either figure related to the highest frequency or the highest percentage, the outcome is strongly agree.\n By using either related to the highest frequency or the highest percentage, the outcome is strongly agree for both years this indicating a high level of support. When combined agree, more than half of the 2014 (32.5% + 25.3% = 57.5%) and (39.5% + 27.0% = 66.5%) 2018 GSS samples agree that homosexuals should have the right to marry.\n     3   This has a level of an interval-ratio. Using frequencies1, we have\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{N+1}{2}\u0026amp;= \\dfrac{32+1}{2}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= 16.5 \\end{aligned}\\] Adding up the frequencies until locating the 16th and 17th cases yields the category 40 hr worked last week.\n We have\n   25th percentile = \\((32 × 0.25)\\) implying the 8th case, or 30 hr worked last week. 50th percentile is simply the median implying the category 40 hr worked last week. 75th percentile = \\((32 × 0.75)\\) implying the 24th case, or 40 hr worked last week.     4   The mode category is agree.\n Using frequencies, we find that the median is 2, or agree.\n    20th percentile = \\((835 × 0.20)\\) implying the 167th case, or strongly agree. 80th percentile = \\((835 × 0.80)\\) implying the 668th case, or agree.     5        Race  Mode  Median      Black  Seldom  Sometimes    Hispanic  Everyday  Nearly everyday    White  Everyday  Most days      Teens’ breakfast habits vary by race/ethnicity. Out of the three racial/ethnic groups, Black students were more likely to report seldom or sometimes eating breakfast. On the other hand, White and Hispanic students eat breakfast more frequently. The mode for White and Hispanic students is everyday.     6   The mode for both Males and Females is Working full-time.\nUsing frequencies, we have\n Males:\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{N+1}{2}\u0026amp;= \\dfrac{596+1}{2}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= 298.5 \\end{aligned}\\] Adding up the frequencies until locating the 298th and 299th cases yields the category Working Full Time.\n Females:\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{N+1}{2}\u0026amp;= \\dfrac{781+1}{2}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= 391 \\end{aligned}\\] Adding up the frequencies until locating the 391th case yields the category Working Full Time. Using either the mode or median implies that there are no substantial differences between males and females.\n     10   \n  Hours Worked Last Week  Frequency  Hours Worked Last Week x Frequency      20  3  60    25  2  50    28  1  28    29  1  29    30  3  90    32  1  32    40  14  560    50  2  100    52  1  52    55  1  55    60  1  60    64  1  64    70  1  70    Total  32  1250      so we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\overline{Y}\u0026amp;=\\dfrac{1250}{32}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 39.06 \\end{aligned}\\] or about 39 hours.\nSince the median was 40 hr worked last week, the distribution is slightly skewed in a positive direction.     11   Since Clinton and Sanders’ middle-class income amount is higher than the U.S. Census estimated mean or median, their definition of middle class is not based on the statistical middle. It is unclear what they were using but it was not based on the actual measure.    You can also do this using cumulative percentages.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e88d964593b0aaae2fd68b3980f5582","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/03-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/03-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      3  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  75-97      Notes:","tags":null,"title":"Measures of Central Tendency","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      4  1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  143-150      Notes:\n Please submit this at the beginning of class next week. Remember to follow the homework guidelines for consideration.  Solutions   1   There are seven response categories for political views.\n We can calculate the percentage square by\n   Political Views\n Percentage \\(c\\)\n Percentage Squared \\(c^2\\)\n     Extremely liberal\n 5.5\n 30.25\n   Liberal\n 12.0\n 144.00\n   Slightly liberal\n 12.3\n 151.29\n   Moderate\n 37.8\n 1428.84\n   Slightly conservative\n 13.2\n 174.24\n   Conservative\n 15.0\n 225.00\n   Extremely conservative\n 4.2\n 17.64\n   Total\n 100.0\n 2171.26\n     yields \\(\\sum c^2 = 2171.26\\).\n We can calculate the IQV by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} IQV\u0026amp;= \\dfrac{7\\cdot(100^2-2171.26)}{100^2\\cdot (7-1)}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{54801.18}{60000}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.91 \\end{aligned}\\] which is relatively close to 1 suggesting that Americans are fairly diverse in their political views.\n     2   For the female population where \\(N = 629\\), we have\n \\(Q_1 = 629\\cdot 0.25 = 157.25\\)\n  \\(Q_3 = 629 \\cdot 0.75 = 471.75\\)\n or about the 158th and 472nd cases which are representative of cases where the degree are in the High school graduate and Bachelor’s degree categories, respectively. This yields \\(IQR = 471.75-157.25=314.5\\) which includes those who have a highest attained degree of high school, junior college and bachelor’s .\nFor the male population where \\(N = 488\\), we have\n \\(Q_1 = 488 \\cdot 0.25 = 122\\)\n  \\(Q_3 = 488 \\cdot 0.75 = 366\\)\n or the 122nd and 366th cases which are representative of cases where the degree are in the High school graduate and Bachelor’s degree categories, respectively. This yields \\(IQR = 366-122=244\\) that includes those who have a highest attained degree of high school, junior college and bachelor’s .\nSo both IQRs provide the same groups of cases.\n Based on the IQR calculation, we know that 50% of all cases for males and females lies between high school and bachelor’s degree, but that does not inform us about the variability of the distribution. A better measure would be IQV and if interval-ratio measures were available, the variance and standard deviation would provide better information and estimates.\n     3   The range of convictions in   2010 is given by \\(397 – 108 =\\) \\(289\\). 2015 is given by \\(402 – 97 =\\) \\(305\\). Therefore the range of conviction in 2015 is larger.  The mean number in 2010 across all levels of government was\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\overline{Y} \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{397+108+280}{3}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 261.67 \\end{aligned}\\] or about an average of 262 convictions.\nThe mean number in 2015 across all levels of government was\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\overline{Y} \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{402+97+200}{3}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;= 233 \\end{aligned}\\] or an average of 233 convictions.\n The sum of squares can be found by\n   Government Level\n Number of Convictions\n \\(Y-\\overline{Y}\\)\n \\((Y-\\overline{Y})^2\\)\n     Federal\n 397\n \\(397 - 261.1 = 135.33\\)\n \\((135.33)^2 = 18314.21\\)\n   State\n 108\n \\(108 - 261.67 = -153.67\\)\n \\((-153.67)^2 = 23614.47\\)\n   Local\n 280\n \\(280 - 261.67 = 18.33\\)\n \\((18.33)^2 = 335.99\\)\n   Total\n 785\n $ $\n 42264.67\n     implying that\n\\[\\begin{aligned} S \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{42264.67}{2}}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 145.37 \\end{aligned}\\] So in 2010, there was a standard deviation of about 145.37.\nThe sum of squares can be found by\n   Government Level\n Number of Convictions\n \\(Y-\\overline{Y}\\)\n \\((Y-\\overline{Y})^2\\)\n     Federal\n 402\n \\(402 - 233 = 169\\)\n \\((169)^2 = 28561\\)\n   State\n 97\n \\(97 - 233 = -136\\)\n \\((-136)^2 = 18496\\)\n   Local\n 200\n \\(200 - 233 = -33\\)\n \\((-33)^2 = 1089\\)\n   Total\n 699\n $ $\n 48146\n     implying that\n\\[\\begin{aligned} S \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{48146}{2}}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 155.15 \\end{aligned}\\] So in 2015, there was a standard deviation of about 155.15.\n The standard deviation is larger in the latter time period so there is more variability in number of convictions in 2015 than in 2010. This supports the results of the range.\n     7   The range can be found by \\(4.50-2.20=\\) \\(2.30\\).\nMeanwhile for \\(n=10\\), we have\n 25th percentile: \\(10\\cdot 0.25 = 2.5\\)th case so \\(\\dfrac{2.40+2.50}{2}=2.45\\)\n  75th percentile: \\(10\\cdot 0.75 = 7.5\\)th case so \\(\\dfrac{3.60+3.60}{2}=3.60\\)\n S. the IQR is \\(3.60 – 2.45 =\\) \\(1.15\\). While both measures will work, the range is a bit more precise, in that it provides a better picture of the variability of divorce rates for all states in the sample.\n The sum of squares can be found by\n   State\n Divorce rate/thousand\n \\(Y-\\overline{Y}\\)\n \\((Y-\\overline{Y})^2\\)\n     Florida\n 3.6\n 3.5 – 3.14\n 0.210\n   Idaho\n 3.9\n 3.9 – 3.14\n 0.460\n   Maine\n 3.2\n 3.2 – 3.14\n 0.004\n   Maryland\n 2.5\n 2.5 – 3.14\n 0.410\n   Nevada\n 4.5\n 4.5 – 3.14\n 1.850\n   New Jersey\n 2.6\n 2.6 – 3.14\n 0.290\n   Texas\n 2.2\n 2.2 – 3.14\n 0.880\n   Vermont\n 2.9\n 2.9 – 3.14\n 0.058\n   Wisconsin\n 2.4\n 2.4 – 3.14\n 0.550\n   Total\n 31.4\n  4.922\n     implying that\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\overline{Y} \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3.6 + 3.6 + 3.9 + 3.2 + 2.5 + 4.5 + 2.6 + 2.2 + 2.9 + 2.4}{10}}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 3.14 \\end{aligned}\\] and\n\\[\\begin{aligned} S \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{4.922}{9}}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.74 \\end{aligned}\\] So between 1997-2017, the average divorce rate per 1000 people was about \\(3\\) with an approximated standard deviation of 0.74.\n Divorce rates may vary by state due to multiple factors which are not represented in the included data set such as variations in employment status, policies and laws by region (i.e. states with no-fault divorce laws), religious beliefs, etc.\n     8   DEGREE is an ordinal measure whereas AGEKDBRN is an interval measure.\n As DEGREE increases, AGEKDBRN increases as well implying the likelihood of a positive relationship. The youngest first-time parents are those with less than a high school degree, while the oldest first-time parents are those with graduate degrees with difference \\(28.59 – 21.33 = 7.26\\) years. The variability in age when first child was born is larger as educational attainment increases. The standard deviation for the high school degree group is largest at \\(5.498\\) years, the smallest is for the some college group with \\(4.581\\).\n     11   Type of Work is a nominal variable implying that the appropriate measure of variability as the index of qualitative variation (IQV).\n The pertage squared for both grades can be found by\n  Type of Work\n Grade 8 Percentage \\(c\\)\n Grade 8 Percentage Squared \\(c^2\\)\n Grade 10 Percentage \\(c\\)\n Grade 10 Percentage Squared \\(c^2\\)\n     Lawn work\n 28\n \\((28)^2 = 784\\)\n 20\n \\((20)^2 = 400\\)\n   Food service\n 3\n \\((3)^2 = 9\\)\n 10\n \\((10)^2 = 100\\)\n   Babysitting\n 37\n \\((37)^2 = 1369\\)\n 28\n \\((28)^2 = 784\\)\n   Other\n 32\n \\((32)^2 = 1024\\)\n 42\n \\((42)^2 = 1764\\)\n   Total\n 100\n \\(3186\\)\n 100\n \\(2048\\)\n    So the IQV for both grades can be found by\n Grade 8: \\(\\dfrac{4\\cdot(100^2-3186)}{100^2\\cdot (4-1)} = \\dfrac{27256}{30000} = 0.91\\)\n  Grade 10: \\(\\dfrac{4\\cdot(100^2-3048)}{100^2\\cdot (4-1)} = \\dfrac{27808}{30000} = 0.93\\)\n implying IQV(Grade 8) \\(=0.91\\) and IQV(Grade 10) \\(=0.93\\).\n Though both IQVs are greater than \\(0.90\\), there is slightly more variation among 10th graders than 8th gradersin the type of jobs they hold. The difference may be attributed to more employment options for older students and limitations for younger studentsxxxx leading to more informal jobs such as lawn work and babysitting.\n     12   Using the summary statistics for life expectancy    Measure  Statistic for European Countries  Statistic for Non-european Countries      Median  81.500  82.70    Variance  7.985  11.65    Standard deviation  2.830  3.41    Minimum  75.300  76.30    Maximum  82.000  85.50    Range  6.700  9.20    Interquartile range  3.800  4.95      we find that the variable is interval ratio implying that variance (or standard deviation), range, or IQR are possible and valid. Among these three measures, variance and/or standard deviation is preferred for precision. For just the average life expectancy for these 10 countries, we should rely on the mean.\nOn average, non-European countries have a slightly higher life expectancy at birth (\\(82.00\\) vs. \\(80.30\\)). Both the mean and median are higher for non-European countries than for European countries. Also, the distribution of non-European countries exhibits more variability; the standard deviation for European countries is \\(3.41\\) years, while for non-European countries it is \\(2.83\\) years.\nThese differences might be explained by access and availability of health care and/or diet. However, the difference might simply be random due to the small number of countries presented in this example. We are likely to find different results if more countries were incorporated into the analyses.\n   13   Overall, Clinton voters were younger, more educated, and attended religious services less than Trump voters. The youngest voters were male Clinton voters at \\(50.49\\) years (\\(s = 18.84\\)), followed by female Clinton voters, \\(51.93\\) years (\\(s = 18.21\\)). For education, males who voted for Clinton had the highest mean of \\(14.69\\) (\\(s = 2.73\\)). Males who voted for Trump had \\(13.80\\) years of education (\\(s = 2.75\\)). Trump voters, both males and females, attended religious services more often than Clinton voters. Mean scores were \\(3.72\\) for males (\\(s = 2.93\\)) and \\(3.82\\) for females (\\(s = 2.75\\)), indicating church attendance about several times a year to once a month. The standard deviations indicate a consistency in the distributions of education, age, and religious service attendance across all four groups. The largest standard deviations are for age, ranging from \\(15.94\\) to \\(18.84\\) years. These wide standard deviations indicate more dispersion around the mean age scores.\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c0768ad82187a280e198c647e412210f","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/04-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/04-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      4  1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  143-150      Notes:","tags":null,"title":"Measures of Variability","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"     Textbook Notes In Class Notes R Walkthrough    function resizeIframe(obj) { obj.style.height = obj.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }   .hvr-sweep-to-left { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; -webkit-transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); position: relative; -webkit-transition-property: color; transition-property: color; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.25s; transition-duration: 0.25s; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:before { content: \"\"; position: absolute; z-index: -1; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: #761756; -webkit-transform: scaleX(0); transform: scaleX(0); -webkit-transform-origin: 100% 50%; transform-origin: 100% 50%; -webkit-transition-property: transform; transition-property: transform; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.3s; transition-duration: 0.3s; -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease-out; transition-timing-function: ease-out; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:hover, .hvr-sweep-to-left:focus, .hvr-sweep-to-left:active { color: white; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:hover:before, .hvr-sweep-to-left:focus:before, .hvr-sweep-to-left:active:before { -webkit-transform: scaleX(1); transform: scaleX(1); }  Textbook Notes         Chapter 4 PowerPoint  Chapter 4 Notes            In Class Notes  You can move back and forth using ← and → and toggle fullscreen by pressing F.

Remember to follow the homework guidelines for consideration.   Week 5 Problem Set   1   We are looking the area under the curve greater than \\(8\\). The \\(z\\)-score for a person who watches more than 8 hr/day is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{8-2.97}{3.00}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 1.68 \\end{aligned}\\] So \\(z \\approx 1.68\\).\n We are looking the area under the curve less than \\(5\\). The \\(z\\)-score for a person who watches less than 5 hr/day is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{5-2.97}{3.00}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.68 \\end{aligned}\\] So \\(z \\approx 0.68\\). Since the area between \\(z=0.68\\) and \\(z=0\\) is \\(0.2517\\), we have \\(0.5000+0.2517=0.7517\\). This implies that \\(0.7517\\cdot 1014 \\approx\\) \\(762\\) or \\(763\\) people watch television less than 5 hours/day.\n We have\n\\[\\begin{aligned} Y\u0026amp;=2.97+1\\cdot 3\\\\ \u0026amp;= 5.97 \\end{aligned}\\] implying that 5.97 television hr/day corresponds to a \\(z\\)-score of \\(+1\\).\n We are looking at the area between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\). The \\(z\\)-score for a person who watches more than 1 hr/day is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{1-2.97}{3.00}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -0.66 \\end{aligned}\\] with the area between the mean and \\(z=0.66\\) found to be \\(0.2454\\). The \\(z\\)-score for a person who watches less than 6 hr/day is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{6-2.97}{3.00}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 1.01 \\end{aligned}\\] with the area between the mean and \\(z=1.01\\) found to be \\(0.3438\\).\nSo the percentage of people who watch between 1 hr/day and 6 hr/day of television can be found by \\(0.2454 + 0.3438 = 0.5892\\), or about \\(59\\%\\).\n     2   The 95th percentile, or \\(0.9500\\) is approximately equivalent to \\(z=1.65\\). So the number of women needing shelter is\n\\[\\begin{aligned} Y\u0026amp;= 250+1.65\\cdot 75\\\\ \u0026amp;= 373.75 \\end{aligned}\\] or about \\(374\\) women. Since this figure exceeds the total capacity of 350, there will not be enough space for all abused women on 95% of all nights. at minimum, the city needs \\(374\\) beds.\n We are looking the area under the curve greater than \\(220\\). The \\(z\\)-score for exceeding the capacity is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{220-250}{75}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -0.40 \\end{aligned}\\] The area below this value is \\(0.3446\\), so the area exceeding this is \\(1 – 0.3446 = 0.6554\\), or about \\(66\\%\\) of all nights the number of women seeking shelter will exceed the capacity of 220.\n     5   We are looking at the area between \\(12\\) and \\(16\\) for the Working class. The \\(z\\)-score for a person with more than 12 years of education is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{12-13.05}{2.77}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -0.38 \\end{aligned}\\] with the area between the mean and \\(z=-0.38\\) found to be \\(0.1480\\).\nThe \\(z\\)-score for a person who watches less than 16 years of education is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{16-13.05}{2.77}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 1.06 \\end{aligned}\\] with the area between the mean and \\(z=1.06\\) found to be \\(0.3554\\).\nSo the proportion of working-class respondents with 12–16 years of education can be found by \\(0.1480 + 0.3554 =\\) \\(0.5034\\).\nWe are still looking at the area between \\(12\\) and \\(16\\) for the Upper class. The \\(z\\)-score for a person with more than 12 years of education is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{12-15.48}{2.76}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -1.26 \\end{aligned}\\] with the area between the mean and \\(z=-1.26\\) found to be \\(0.3962\\).\nThe \\(z\\)-score for a person who watches less than 16 years of education is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{16-15.48}{2.67}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.19 \\end{aligned}\\] with the area between the mean and \\(z=0.19\\) found to be \\(0.0753\\).\nSo the proportion of upper-class respondents with 12–16 years of education can be found by \\(0.3962 + 0.0753 =\\) \\(0.4715\\).\n We are looking the area under the curve greater than \\(16\\). For working-class respondents, the \\(z\\)-score is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{16-12.05}{2.77}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 1.06 \\end{aligned}\\] The area between \\(z=1.06\\) and the tail is \\(0.1446\\) thus implying the probability of a working-class respondent having more than 16 years of education is \\(14.46\\%\\).\nFor middle-class respondents, the \\(z\\)-score is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{16-14.56}{2.95}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.49 \\end{aligned}\\] The area between \\(z=0.49\\) and the tail is \\(0.3121\\) thus implying the probability of a middle-class respondent having more than 16 years of education is \\(31.21\\%\\).\n We are looking the area under the curve less than \\(10\\). For middle-class respondents, the \\(z\\)-score is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{16-14.56}{2.95}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.49 \\end{aligned}\\] The area beyond \\(z=0.63\\) and the tail is \\(0.2643\\) thus implying the probability of a lower-class respondent having more less 10 years of education is \\(26.43\\%\\).\n     6   We are looking the area under the curve greater than \\(625\\). For these high school graduates, the \\(z\\)-score is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{625-536}{102}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.87 \\end{aligned}\\] The area beyond \\(z=0.87\\) and the tail is \\(0.1992\\) thus implying the probability that a high school graduate having earning a score of more than 625 is \\(19.92\\%\\).\n We are looking the area under the curve between than \\(400\\) and \\(625\\). For these high school graduates, the \\(z\\)-score for 625 is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{625-536}{102}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.87 \\end{aligned}\\] The area between the mean and \\(z=0.87\\) is \\(0.3087\\).\nFor these high school graduates, the \\(z\\)-score for 400 is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{400-536}{102}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -1.33 \\end{aligned}\\] The area between\\(z=-1.33\\) and the mean is \\(0.4082\\).\nSumming these proportions yields \\(0.3087+0.4082=0.7168\\), or \\(71.68\\%\\) of the high school graduates earned a score between 400 and 625.\n The 20th percentile, or \\(0.2000\\) is equivalent to \\(z=-0.84\\). Thus the SAT ERW equivalency can be found by \\(536-0.84\\cdot 102=450.32\\), or a score of \\(450\\).\n     7   We have\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{150-100}{15} \u0026amp;\\approx 3.33 \\end{aligned}\\] or \\(z\\approx 3.33\\).\n We are looking the area under the curve greater than \\(150\\). The area beyond \\(z=3.33\\) is \\(0.0004\\) implying that the percentage of scores above 150 is \\(0.04\\%\\)1.\n We are looking at the area between \\(85\\) and \\(150\\). The \\(z\\)-score for a score of 85 is\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{85-100}{15}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -1 \\end{aligned}\\] with the area between \\(z=-1\\) and the mean found to be \\(0.3413\\). The \\(z\\)-score for a score of 150 is\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{150-100}{15} \u0026amp;\\approx 3.33 \\end{aligned}\\] with the area between the mean and \\(z=3.33\\) found to be \\(0.4996\\).\nSo the \\(0.3413 + 0.4996 = 0.8409\\), or about \\(84\\%\\) of scores fall between \\(85\\) and \\(150\\).\n Scoring in the 95th percentile means that 95% of the sample scored below this level. This outcome can be calculated by \\(100 + 1.65\\cdot 15 = 124.75\\). So the IQ score that is associated with the 95th percentile is \\(124.75\\).\n     8   We are looking the area under the curve less than \\(400\\). For these high school graduates, the \\(z\\)-score is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{400-531}{114}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -1.15 \\end{aligned}\\] The area beyond \\(z=-1.15\\) and the tail is \\(0.1251\\) thus implying that about \\(12.51\\%\\)of high school graduates hearned a score less than 400.\n We are looking the area under the curve between than \\(600\\) and \\(700\\). For these high school graduates, the \\(z\\)-score for 600 is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{600-531}{114}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.61 \\end{aligned}\\] The area between the mean and \\(z=0.61\\) is \\(0.2291\\).\nFor these high school graduates, the \\(z\\)-score for 700 is given by\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{700-531}{114}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 1.48 \\end{aligned}\\] The area between \\(z=1.48\\) and the mean is \\(0.4306\\).\nSubtracting these proportions yields \\(0.4306-0.2291=0.2015\\), or \\(20.15\\%\\) of the high school graduates earned a score between 600 and 700\n For an earned score of \\(725\\) which is greater than the mean, we have From this we can calculate the \\(z\\)-score as\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{725-531}{114}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 1.70 \\end{aligned}\\] The area beyond \\(z=1.70\\) is \\(0.0466\\). So the percentile rank may be found by \\(1.000-0.0466 = 0.9535\\), or \\(95.35\\%\\) which implies the 96th percentile.\n     11   For an earned score of \\(990\\) which is greater than the mean, we have From this we can calculate the \\(z\\)-score as\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{990-981}{27.3}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.33 \\end{aligned}\\] The area beyond \\(z=0.33\\) is \\(0.3707\\). So the percentile rank may be found by \\(1.000-0.3707 = 0.6293\\), or \\(62.93\\%\\) which implies the 62nd percentile. So the team is not in the upper quartile.\n For the top 25%, or \\(0.0025\\), the area beyond \\(z\\) is approximated by \\(z = 0.67\\). The cutoff score is then \\(981+0.67\\cdot 27.3\\approx\\) \\(999.29\\).\n As noted above, \\(z = 0.67\\).\n     12   For Team A an eligibility criterion score of \\(971\\) is given by From this we can calculate the \\(z\\)-score as\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{971-983}{33}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -0.36 \\end{aligned}\\] For Team A a retention criterion score of \\(958\\) is given by From this we can calculate the \\(z\\)-score as\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{958-976}{34.9}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -0.52 \\end{aligned}\\] For Team B an eligibility criterion score of \\(987\\) is given by From this we can calculate the \\(z\\)-score as\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{987-983}{33}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.12 \\end{aligned}\\] For Team B a retention criterion score of \\(970\\) is given by From this we can calculate the \\(z\\)-score as\n\\[\\begin{aligned} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{970-976}{34.9}\\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx -0.17 \\end{aligned}\\] So Team B is better on both eligibility and retention than Team A.\n For Team B a retention criterion score of \\(z=-0.17\\) is below the mean and the corresponding proportion can be viewed by which is the area between \\(z\\) and the tail, or \\(0.4325\\).\n For Team A an eligibility criterion score of \\(z=-0.36\\) is below the mean and the corresponding proportion can be viewed by which is the area between \\(z\\) and the tail, or \\(0.3594\\) implying about the 35th percentile.\n     Which is the reason you don’t notice any shading in the plot↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4c170f0ac819351a0e29685f5fd9a3a6","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/05-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/05-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      5  1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  174-178      Notes:","tags":null,"title":"The Normal Distribution","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    Textbook Notes In Class Notes    function resizeIframe(obj) { obj.style.height = obj.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px'; }   .hvr-sweep-to-left { display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; -webkit-transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); transform: perspective(1px) translateZ(0); box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); position: relative; -webkit-transition-property: color; transition-property: color; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.25s; transition-duration: 0.25s; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:before { content: \"\"; position: absolute; z-index: -1; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: #761756; -webkit-transform: scaleX(0); transform: scaleX(0); -webkit-transform-origin: 100% 50%; transform-origin: 100% 50%; -webkit-transition-property: transform; transition-property: transform; -webkit-transition-duration: 0.3s; transition-duration: 0.3s; -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease-out; transition-timing-function: ease-out; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:hover, .hvr-sweep-to-left:focus, .hvr-sweep-to-left:active { color: white; } .hvr-sweep-to-left:hover:before, .hvr-sweep-to-left:focus:before, .hvr-sweep-to-left:active:before { -webkit-transform: scaleX(1); transform: scaleX(1); }  Textbook Notes         Chapter 6 PowerPoint  Chapter 6 Notes            In Class Notes Part I  You can move back and forth using ← and → and toggle fullscreen by pressing F.

Solutions   1   Although there are problems with the collection of data from all Americans, the census is assumed to be complete, so the mean age would be a parameter.\n A statistic because it is estimated from a sample.\n A parameter because the school would have information on all its students.\n A statistic because it is estimated from a sample.\n A parameter because the school has information on all employees.\n     2   First, the population is not clearly defined. Are the population subscribers to the newspaper? Readers of the newspaper? Or some other set of people? Even given this uncertainty, the letters to the editor would only be a random sample of a population if, clearly, they came randomly from that population. But there is no reason to assume this to be the case. People with stronger opinions, who can write reasonably well, and who have the time to write are more likely to write the editor. Since these characteristics are not distributed randomly throughout the adult population, it is improbable that the letters are a random sample.\n The mayor might consider forming a coalition to randomly sample landline and cell phone numbers of city residents.\n     3   Assuming that the population is defined as all persons shopping at that shopping mall that day of the week, she is selecting a systematic random sample. A more precise definition might limit it to all persons passing by the department store at the mall that day.\n This is a stratified sample because voters were first grouped by county, and unless the counties have the same number of voters, it is a disproportionate stratified sample because the same number is chosen from each county. We can assume that it was a probability sample, but we are not told exactly how the 50 voters were chosen from the lists. However, assuming that the population is defined as all Americans, this sort of sampling technique would qualify as nonprobability sampling.\n This is neither a simple random sample nor a systematic random sample. It might be thought of as a sample stratified on last name, but even then, choosing the first 20 names is not a random selection process.\n This is not a probability sample. Instead, it is a purposive sample chosen to represent a cross section of the population in New York City.\n     4   There are 120 students where 57 are juniors who represent \\(57\\div120 = 47.5\\), or 47.5% of the class. This implies the probability of choosing a junior is \\(0.475\\).\n The probability that the student will be a freshman is \\(7\\div120 =\\) \\(0.058\\).\n The proportion of seniors in the class is \\(34/120 = 0.283\\). The proportion of sophomores is \\(22\\div120 = 0.183\\). Then the number of students to be chosen at each class level is:\n  Class Level  Calculation  Result      Freshman  0.058(30)  1.74    Sophomore  0.183(30)  5.49    Junior  0.475(30)  14.25    Senior  0.283(30)  8.49       or about 2 freshman, 5 sophomores, 14 juniors, and 8 seniors.\n For a disproportionate sample we choose the same number of students from each class level. For example, we could have 5 freshman, 5 sophomores, 5 juniors, and 5 seniors.\n     5   The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}\\). Since \\(\\sigma\\) is divided by \\(\\sqrt{N}\\), \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}\\) must always be smaller than \\(\\sigma\\) barring the trivial case where \\(N = 1\\). Theoretically, the dispersion of the mean must be less than the dispersion of the raw scores. This implies that the standard error of the mean is less than the standard deviation.\n    6   First note that the standard error of the mean is proportional to \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\).  The standard error of the mean is\n\\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{100}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{10}\\) for a sample size of 100\n\\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{1600}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{40}\\) for a sample size of 16000\nWe compare the two by \\(\\frac{40}{10} =4\\). So \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}\\) is smaller by a factor of 4 when the sample size increases from 100 to 1600.\n The standard error of the mean is\n\\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{300}}\\approx\\frac{\\sigma}{17.32}\\) for a sample size of 300\n\\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{150}}\\approx\\frac{\\sigma}{12.25}\\) for a sample size of 150\nWe compare the two by \\(\\frac{17.32}{12.25} \\approx 1.41\\). So \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}\\) is greater by a factor of 1.41 when the sample size decreases from 300 to 150.\n For simplicity, assume an initial sample size of 100. We then have \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{100}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{10}\\) for a sample size of 10 0\n\\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{4\\cdot100}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{20}\\) for a sample size of 4000\nWe compare the two by \\(\\frac{20}{10} = 2\\). So \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{Y}} =\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}\\) decreases by a factor of 2.\n     7   Facebook ® polls are most definitely not probability samples. While many reasons exists, the two noted below are likely the most important: - the population from which data are gathered is limited to the friends on one’s Facebook ® profile–and such is certainly not a representative sample from the larger population. - due to Facebook ® algorithms, we can’t be sure that every Facebook ® friend would have the same opportunity to see, and thus participate, in the poll.\n The population is our Facebook ® friends who come across the poll.\n     8  First we convert these to a vector and take the sum\nmilitary \u0026lt;- c(229634, 64564, 376034, 89826, 26384, 41441, 177336, 68440, 8579) total_mil \u0026lt;- sum(military)  The mean number of active military personnel per region in 2009 was\nmu_mil = mean(military) mu_mil ## [1] 120248.7 or about 120249. The standard deviation is\nsd_pop=function(x){sd(x)*sqrt((length(x)-1)/length(x))} sigma_mil = sd_pop(military) sigma_mil ## [1] 112966.1 or about 112966.\n We can use the sample command to get our 10 sample means of size 3. We can use the replcate and rnorm commands in R to do this\n# replicate(size #, rnorm(#of sample means, mu, sigma)) samples \u0026lt;- replicate(3,rnorm(10, mu_mil,sigma_mil)) samples ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -64438.11 244546.51 -83414.36 ## [2,] -39899.40 65659.24 95196.71 ## [3,] 291216.92 -63230.00 185549.48 ## [4,] 85241.35 166482.75 74791.47 ## [5,] 323549.10 108933.75 223259.91 ## [6,] 145593.95 39567.78 69088.96 ## [7,] 35998.17 101087.86 49674.33 ## [8,] 99431.77 63863.54 184519.83 ## [9,] 96077.14 122276.32 168509.14 ## [10,] 38199.01 70128.06 -53798.73 The mean of these 10 sets of means is\nmean(samples) ## [1] 94788.75 or about 105428. We notice that the population mean and the mean of the sampling distribution are somewhat close, a feature that we should come to expect given the fact that \\(\\mu_Y = \\mu_{\\overline{Y}}\\).\n The standard deviation of these 10 sets of means is\nsd(samples) ## [1] 101356 or about 122991.\n The population distribution is positively skewed and not close to normal. Since a very small sample size is used in this problem, the histogram for the samples of size 3 does not look normal. The distributions appear unimodal. The fact that the sample distribution of the means tends toward normality because of the Central Limit Theorem would become even more apparent if we took samples of size 5 or 6. To show this, look at the plots below      9   This is not a reliable sample. The students eating lunch on Tuesday are not necessarily representative of all students at the school, and you have no way of calculating the probability of inclusion of any student. Many students might, for example, rarely eat lunch at the student union and, therefore, have no chance of being represented in your sample. The fact that you selected all the students eating lunch on Tuesday makes your selection appear to be a census of a population, but that isn’t true either unless all the students ate at the student union on Tuesday.\n This is not a reliable sample. The majority of people in attendance at the rally would probably be in support of open borders. Students against such might not have any chance of selection.\n Answers will vary, but it seems the best route would be to obtain a list of all registered students from your university’s registrar. And then employ a known sampling strategy (simple random sampling, stratified sampling, etc.) to create your sample of 10% of the student body. From there, you would reach out to each person you’ve selected via e-mail, telephone, mail, and so on and ask them to complete your survey.\n    ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"074cc079f992c2c675347d86f28cc8f6","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/tasks/07-tasks/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tasks/07-tasks/","section":"tasks","summary":"span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      6  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  206-210      Notes:","tags":null,"title":"Sampling and Sampling Distributions","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    span.boxed { border: 0px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #005b96; display: inline; } table { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } tr:nth-child(even) { background: #ffffff; }  Homework     Chapter  Problems  Source  Pages      7  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10  Social Statistics for a Diverse Society  275-280      Notes:\n Please submit this at the beginning of class next week. Remember to follow the homework guidelines for consideration.   Solutions   1   The estimate at the 90% confidence level is 20.87–21.13%. This means that there are 90 chances out of 100 that the confidence interval will contain the true population percentage of victims in the American population. Due to the large sample size, we converted the proportions to percentages, subtracting from 100, rather than 1. \\[\\begin{align} s_p \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{21\\cdot(100-21)}{239541}}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.08 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 21\\pm 1.65\\cdot0.08\\\\ \u0026amp;= 21\\pm 0.13\\\\ \u0026amp;= (20.87, 21.13) \\end{align}\\] So the standard error of the mean is approximately 0.08 with a confidence interval between 20.87 to 21.13.\n The true percentage of crime victims in the American population is somewhere between 20.79% and 21.21% based on the 99% confidence interval. There are 99 chances out of 100 that the confidence interval will contain the true population percentage of crime victims. \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 21\\pm 2.58\\cdot0.08\\\\ \u0026amp;= 21\\pm 0.21\\\\ \u0026amp;= (20.79, 21.21) \\end{align}\\] So we have a confidence interval between 20.79 to 21.21.\n     2   For lower-class respondents, we have \\[\\begin{align} S_{\\overline{Y}} \u0026amp;=\\dfrac{3.08}{\\sqrt{102}}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;\\approx 0.30 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 12.19\\pm 1.96\\cdot0.30\\\\ \u0026amp;= 12.19\\pm 0.59\\\\ \u0026amp;= (11.60, 12.78) \\end{align}\\] So the estimated standard error for the sampling distribution is approximately 0.30 with a confidence interval between 11.60 to 12.78.\nFor working-class respondents, we have \\[\\begin{align} S_{\\overline{Y}} \u0026amp;=\\dfrac{2.93}{\\sqrt{523}}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;\\approx 0.13 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 13.16\\pm 1.96\\cdot0.13\\\\ \u0026amp;= 13.16\\pm 0.25\\\\ \u0026amp;= (12.91, 13.41) \\end{align}\\] So the estimated standard error for the sampling distribution is approximately 0.13 with a confidence interval between 12.91 to 13.41.\n For lower-class respondents, we have \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 12.19\\pm 2.58\\cdot0.30\\\\ \u0026amp;= 12.19\\pm 0.77\\\\ \u0026amp;= (11.42, 12.96) \\end{align}\\] So the confidence interval is between 11.42 to 12.96.\nFor working-class respondents, we have \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 14.60\\pm 2.58\\cdot0.13\\\\ \u0026amp;= 14.60\\pm 0.34\\\\ \u0026amp;= (14.26, 14.94) \\end{align}\\] So the confidence interval is between 14.26 to 14.94.\n As our confidence level increases, the confidence interval gets wider, not narrower. This is because a wider interval is needed to increase the probability that our calculated interval includes the true population value. Thus, increasing confidence leads to less precise intervals.\n     3   For Canadians we have \\[\\begin{align} s_p \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.51\\cdot(1-0.51)}{1004}}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.02 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 0.51\\pm 1.96\\cdot0.02\\\\ \u0026amp;= 0.51\\pm 0.04\\\\ \u0026amp;= (0.47, 0.55) \\end{align}\\] So the estimated standard error of proportions is approximately 0.02 with a confidence interval between 0.47 to 0.55.\n For Americans we have \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 0.45\\pm 1.96\\cdot0.02\\\\ \u0026amp;= 0.45\\pm 0.04\\\\ \u0026amp;= (0.39, 0.49) \\end{align}\\] implying a confidence interval between 0.39 to 0.49.\n Based upon the calculated 95% confidence interval, the majority of Americans do not believe climate change is a serious problem. The true percentage of Americans who believe climate change is a serious problem is under 50%, somewhere between 39% and 49%, based upon this Pew Research Center sample. On the other hand, it is possible that the majority of Canadians believe climate change is a serious problem. We can be 95% confident that the true percentage of Canadians is somewhere between 47% and 55%.\n     4   We have a 90% confidence interval for the males by calculating \\[\\begin{align} s_p \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.21\\cdot(1-0.21)}{337}}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.02 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 0.21\\pm 1.65\\cdot0.02\\\\ \u0026amp;= 0.21\\pm 0.03\\\\ \u0026amp;= (0.18, 0.24) \\end{align}\\] implying an estimated standard error of proportions is approximately 0.02 with a confidence interval between 0.18 to 0.24.\n We have a 90% confidence interval for the demales by calculating \\[\\begin{align} s_p \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.37\\cdot(1-0.37)}{441}}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.02 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 0.37\\pm 1.65\\cdot0.02\\\\ \u0026amp;= 0.37\\pm 0.03\\\\ \u0026amp;= (0.34, 0.40) \\end{align}\\] implying an estimated standard error of proportions is approximately 0.02 with a confidence interval between 0.34 to 0.40.\n     5   Due to the large sample size, we converted the proportion to full percentages, subtracting from 100 rather than 1. \\[\\begin{align} s_p \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{51\\cdot(100-51)}{5490}}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.67 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 51\\pm 1.96\\cdot0.67\\\\ \u0026amp;= 51\\pm 0.13\\\\ \u0026amp;= (49.69, 52.31) \\end{align}\\] We set the interval at the 95% confidence level. However, no matter whether the 90%, 95%, or 99% confidence level is chosen, the calculated interval includes values below 50% for the vote for a Republican candidate. Therefore, you should tell your supervisors that it would not be possible to declare a Republican candidate the likely winner of the votes coming from men if there was an election today because it seems quite possible that less than a majority of male voters would support her/him.\n    10   For Bernie Sanders we have \\[\\begin{align} s_p \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.55\\cdot(1-0.55)}{1754}}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.01 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 0.55\\pm 1.65\\cdot0.01\\\\ \u0026amp;= 0.55\\pm 0.02\\\\ \u0026amp;= (0.53, 0.57) \\end{align}\\] implying an estimated standard error of proportions is approximately 0.02 with a confidence interval between 0.53 to 0.57.\nFor Hillary Clinton we have \\[\\begin{align} s_p \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.38\\cdot(1-0.38)}{1754}}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.01 \\end{align}\\] and \\[\\begin{align} CI \u0026amp;= 0.38\\pm 1.65\\cdot0.01\\\\ \u0026amp;= 0.38\\pm 0.02\\\\ \u0026amp;= (0.36, 0.40) \\end{align}\\] implying an estimated standard error of proportions is approximately 0.02 with a confidence interval between 0.36 to 0.40.

Solutions Note: The \\(z\\) value obtained will be referenced by the variable \\(z_{obt}\\).\n  1   We have \\[\\begin{align} H_0:\\,\\mu_Y=13.5\\,\\,\\text{years}\\\\ H_1:\\,\\mu_Y\u0026lt;13.5\\,\\,\\text{years} \\end{align}\\]\n We have \\[\\begin{align} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{10.9-13.5}{7.6/\\sqrt{150}}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;\\approx -4.19 \\end{align}\\] yielding that \\(z\\) value, or \\(z_{obt} = -4.19\\). The \\(p\\)-value for this \\(z_{obt} \u0026lt; 0.001\\) for a one-tailed test where \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\). Since \\(z_{obt} \u0026lt; 0.001\\) and \\(0.001 \u0026lt; \\alpha\\), we reject \\(H_0\\) and can likely assume that the doctors at the HMO do have less experience than the population of doctors at all HMOs.\n     2   We have\n\\[\\begin{align} s_{p_1-p_2} \u0026amp;=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.43\\cdot(1-0.43)}{899}+\\dfrac{0.50\\cdot(1-0.50)}{351}}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{0.0313}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.03 \\end{align}\\] implying \\[\\begin{align} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{0.43-0.50}{0.03}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;\\approx -2.33 \\end{align}\\] so \\(z_{obt} = -2.33\\) and the probability of obtaining this \\(z\\) statistic is \\(0.0099\\cdot 2=0.0198\\) which is less than \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\). So we reject \\(H_0\\) and can likely assume there is a significant difference in the proportion of homeowners between first-generation and second-generation Hispanic Americans. In fact given we have \\(0.43-0.50=-0.07\\), there is a lower proportion of home ownership among first-generation Hispanic Americans than second-generation Hispanic Americans.\n We have\n\\[\\begin{align} s_{p_1-p_2} \u0026amp;=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.58\\cdot(1-0.58)}{2684}+\\dfrac{0.51\\cdot(1-0.51)}{566}}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{0.0229}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.02 \\end{align}\\] implying \\[\\begin{align} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{0.58-0.51}{0.02}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;\\approx 3.50 \\end{align}\\] so \\(z_{obt} = 3.50\\) and the probability of obtaining this \\(z\\) statistic is \\(0.002\\cdot 2=0.0004\\) which is less than \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\). So we reject \\(H_0\\) and can likely assume there is a significant difference in the proportion of homeowners between first-generation and second-generation Asian Americans. In fact given we have \\(0.58-0.51=0.07\\), there is a higher proportion of home ownership among first-generation Hispanic Americans than second-generation Hispanic Americans.\n     3     Item  Test  Research Hypothesis  Null Hypothesis      \\(\\text{a}\\)  Two-tailed  \\(\\mu\\neq53657\\)  \\(\\mu=53657\\)    \\(\\text{b}\\)  One-tailed  \\(\\mu\u0026gt;3.2\\)  \\(\\mu=3.2\\)    \\(\\text{c}\\)  One-tailed  \\(\\mu_1\u0026lt;\\mu_2\\)  \\(\\mu_1=\\mu_2\\)    \\(\\text{d}\\)  Two-tailed  \\(\\mu_1\\neq\\mu_2\\)  \\(\\mu_1=\\mu_2\\)    \\(\\text{e}\\)  One-tailed  \\(\\mu_1\u0026gt;\\mu_2\\)  \\(\\mu_1=\\mu_2\\)    \\(\\text{f}\\)  One-tailed  \\(\\mu_1\u0026lt;\\mu_2\\)  \\(\\mu_1=\\mu_2\\)          4   We have \\[\\begin{align} H_0:\\,\\pi_1=\\pi_2\\\\ H_1:\\,\\pi_1\u0026lt;\\pi_2 \\end{align}\\]\n We have \\[\\begin{align} s_{p_1-p_2} \u0026amp;=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.34\\cdot(1-0.34)}{1799}+\\dfrac{0.41\\cdot(1-0.41)}{1001}}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{0.0003664}\\\\ \u0026amp;\\approx 0.02 \\end{align}\\] implying \\[\\begin{align} z \u0026amp;= \\dfrac{0.34-0.41}{0.02}\\\\[0.5ex] \u0026amp;\\approx -3.50 \\end{align}\\] yielding that \\(z_{obt}=-3.50 \u0026lt;\\alpha = 0.05\\) (and less than \\(0.0002\\) from Appendix A). So the proportion of White respondents who support the tactic of bringing people of different racial backgrounds together to talk about race is lower than the proportion of Black respondents.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud Both R and RStudio are free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can use the free version of RStudio.cloud which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser with some limited capacity. However this means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R. Over the course of the semester, you may want to wean yourself off of the service and install both R and RStudio these things locally.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics.\nHere’s how you install R and RStudio locally\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac, Windows, or Linux:  If you use macOS\n scroll down to the .pkg file that corresponds to your architecture (Intel or ARM). As of this writing, the current version for each is is R-4.1.1.pkg, but please download the most current version.  Download and install XQuartz   If you use Windows\n click base (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.  Download and install Rtools    Double click on the downloaded files (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nDownload RStudio\n The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux, etc.) and will display a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n   Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on Install, type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on Install, type tidyverse, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"86f1654d0114d88986a69932d4d656ee","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/install/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/install/","section":"resources","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!","tags":null,"title":"Installing R, RStudio, and tidyverse","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   While there is no specific rubric, here is a basic outline of what to be looking out for in each task.

There are like a billion little options and features available for math equations—you can find helpful examples of the the most common basic commands here.\nYou can use math in two different ways: inline or in a display block. To use math inline, wrap it in single dollar signs, like $y = mx + b$:\n    Type… …to get    Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon$, or $\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon$. Based on the DAG, the regression model for estimating the effect of education on wages is \\(\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\\), or \\(\\text{Wages} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Education} + \\epsilon\\).    To put an equation on its own line in a display block, wrap it in double dollar signs, like this:\nType…\nThe quadratic equation was an important part of high school math: $$ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ But now we just use computers to solve for $x$. …to get…\n The quadratic equation was an important part of high school math:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nBut now we just use computers to solve for \\(x\\).\n Because dollar signs are used to indicate math equations, you can’t just use dollar signs like normal if you’re writing about actual dollars. For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.\n Tables There are 4 different ways to hand-create tables in Markdown—I say “hand-create” because it’s normally way easier to use R to generate these things with packages like pander (use pandoc.table()) or knitr (use kable()). The two most common are simple tables and pipe tables. You should look at the full documentation here.\nFor simple tables, type…\n Right Left Center Default ------- ------ ---------- ------- 12 12 12 12 123 123 123 123 1 1 1 1 Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Center Default    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1    For pipe tables, type…\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | |------:|:-----|---------|:------:| | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | | 123 | 123 | 123 | 123 | | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Table: Caption goes here …to get…\n Caption goes here  Right Left Default Center    12 12 12 12  123 123 123 123  1 1 1 1     Footnotes There are two different ways to add footnotes (see here for complete documentation): regular and inline.\nRegular notes need (1) an identifier and (2) the actual note. The identifier can be whatever you want. Some people like to use numbers like [^1], but if you ever rearrange paragraphs or add notes before #1, the numbering will be wrong (in your Markdown file, not in the output; everything will be correct in the output). Because of that, I prefer to use some sort of text label:\nType…\nHere is a footnote reference[^1] and here is another [^note-on-dags]. [^1]: This is a note. [^note-on-dags]: DAGs are neat. And here\u0026#39;s more of the document. …to get…\n Here is a footnote reference1 and here is another.2\nAnd here’s more of the document.\n  This is a note.↩︎   DAGs are neat.↩︎     You can also use inline footnotes with ^[Text of the note goes here], which are often easier because you don’t need to worry about identifiers:\nType…\nCausal inference is neat.^[But it can be hard too!] …to get…\n Causal inference is neat.1\n  But it can be hard too!↩︎      Front matter You can include a special section at the top of a Markdown document that contains metadata (or data about your document) like the title, date, author, etc. This section uses a special simple syntax named YAML (or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”) that follows this basic outline: setting: value for setting. Here’s an example YAML metadata section. Note that it must start and end with three dashes (---).\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; --- You can put the values inside quotes (like the date and name in the example above), or you can leave them outside of quotes (like the title in the example above). I typically use quotes just to be safe—if the value you’re using has a colon (:) in it, it’ll confuse Markdown since it’ll be something like title: My cool title: a subtitle, which has two colons. It’s better to do this:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My cool title: a subtitle\u0026quot; --- If you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n--- title: \u0026#39;An evaluation of \u0026quot;scare quotes\u0026quot;\u0026#39; ---  Citations One of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib --- Choose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n--- title: Title of your document date: \u0026quot;January 13, 2020\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;Your name\u0026quot; bibliography: name_of_file.bib csl: \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\u0026quot; --- Some of the most common CSLs are:\n Chicago author-date Chicago note-bibliography Chicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids){target=“_blank”} APA 7th edition MLA 8th edition  Cite things in your document. Check the documentation for full details of how to do this. Essentially, you use @citationkey inside square brackets ([]):\n    Type… …to get…    Causal inference is neat [@Rohrer:2018; @AngristPischke:2015].

You can do everything you can with regular Markdown, but you can incorporate graphs, tables, and other R output directly in your document. You can create HTML, PDF, and Word documents, PowerPoint and HTML presentations, websites, books, and even interactive dashboards with R Markdown. This whole course website is created with R Markdown (and a package named blogdown).\nThe documentation for R Markdown is extremely comprehensive, and their tutorials and cheatsheets are excellent—rely on those.\nHere are the most important things you’ll need to know about R Markdown in this class:\nKey terms  Document: A Markdown file where you type stuff\n Chunk: A piece of R code that is included in your document. It looks like this:\n```{r} # Code goes here ``` There must be an empty line before and after the chunk. The final three backticks must be the only thing on the line—if you add more text, or if you forget to add the backticks, or accidentally delete the backticks, your document will not knit correctly.\n Knit: When you “knit” a document, R runs each of the chunks sequentially and converts the output of each chunk into Markdown. R then runs the knitted document through pandoc to convert it to HTML or PDF or Word (or whatever output you’ve selected).\nYou can knit by clicking on the “Knit” button at the top of the editor window, or by pressing ⌘⇧K on macOS or control + shift + K on Windows.\n   Add chunks There are three ways to insert chunks:\n Press ⌘⌥I on macOS or control + alt + I on Windows\n Click on the “Insert” button at the top of the editor window\n Manually type all the backticks and curly braces (don’t do this)\n   Chunk names You can add names to chunks to make it easier to navigate your document. If you click on the little dropdown menu at the bottom of your editor in RStudio, you can see a table of contents that shows all the headings and chunks. If you name chunks, they’ll appear in the list. If you don’t include a name, the chunk will still show up, but you won’t know what it does.\nTo add a name, include it immediately after the {r in the first line of the chunk. Names cannot contain spaces, but they can contain underscores and dashes. All chunk names in your document must be unique.\n```{r name-of-this-chunk} # Code goes here ```  Chunk options There are a bunch of different options you can set for each chunk. You can see a complete list in the RMarkdown Reference Guide or at knitr’s website.\nOptions go inside the {r} section of the chunk:\n```{r name-of-this-chunk, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} # Code goes here ``` The most common chunk options are these:\n fig.width=5 and fig.height=3 (or whatever number you want): Set the dimensions for figures echo=FALSE: The code is not shown in the final document, but the results are message=FALSE: Any messages that R generates (like all the notes that appear after you load a package) are omitted warning=FALSE: Any warnings that R generates are omitted include=FALSE: The chunk still runs, but the code and results are not included in the final document  You can also set chunk options by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of any chunk:\n Inline chunks You can also include R output directly in your text, which is really helpful if you want to report numbers from your analysis. To do this, use `r r_code_here`.\nIt’s generally easiest to calculate numbers in a regular chunk beforehand and then use an inline chunk to display the value in your text. For instance, this document…\n```{r find-avg-mpg, echo=FALSE} avg_mpg \u0026lt;- mean(mtcars$mpg) ``` The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was `r round(avg_mpg, 1)` miles per gallon. … would knit into this:\n The average fuel efficiency for cars from 1974 was 20.1 miles per gallon.\n  Output formats You can specify what kind of document you create when you knit in the YAML front matter.\ntitle: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; output: html_document: default pdf_document: default word_document: default You can also click on the down arrow on the “Knit” button to choose the output and generate the appropriate YAML. If you click on the gear icon next to the “Knit” button and choose “Output options”, you change settings for each specific output type, like default figure dimensions or whether or not a table of contents is included.\nThe first output type listed under output: will be what is generated when you click on the “Knit” button or press the keyboard shortcut (⌘⇧K on macOS; control + shift + K on Windows). If you choose a different output with the “Knit” button menu, that output will be moved to the top of the output section.\nThe indentation of the YAML section matters, especially when you have settings nested under each output type. Here’s what a typical output section might look like:\n--- title: \u0026quot;My document\u0026quot; author: \u0026quot;My name\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;August 19, 2020\u0026quot; output: html_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 8 fig_width: 10 pdf_document: latex_engine: xelatex # More modern PDF typesetting engine toc: yes word_document: toc: yes fig_caption: yes fig_height: 4 fig_width: 5 ---  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"34712881160d8448b3606651d889c270","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/rmarkdown/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/rmarkdown/","section":"resources","summary":"Key terms Add chunks Chunk names Chunk options Inline chunks Output formats   R Markdown is regular Markdown with R code and output sprinkled in.

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) filter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot; ) But you’ll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there’s an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It’s fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)—you should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ⌘ + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It’s not always perfect, but it’s really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\n Main style things to pay attention to for this class  Important note: I won’t ever grade you on any of this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n Spacing  See the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10) Don’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” \u0026gt; “Global Options” \u0026gt; “Code” \u0026gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026quot;compact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pickup\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;midsize\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;subcompact\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2seater\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;minivan\u0026quot;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Comments  See the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n# Good #Bad #Bad If the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” \u0026gt; “Reflow comment”\n# Good # Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. # Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.

As opposed to open source softwares, you may have difficulties in locating resources that are not commercially linked and worth an investigation.\nSimilar to how Apple operates, Tableau’s parent company Salesforce tightly controls the ecosystem. However for those who want to avoid coding from the ground up, one of major benefits of the visualization software is that it plays well with R. However even with that capability, the interaction is narrowly defined. It also has the largest commercial footprint of those who prefer to pay for a graphical user interface when rendering data visualizations.\nIf you use Twitter, post Tableau-related questions and concerns using TableauSupport using @TableauSupport.

Response times are typically much quicker than the standard 24-48 hours given to emails. Please remember that life is somewhat chaotic at this time!\n  Course objectives Students will become proficient and be able to describe in detail the following aspects:\nAssessing and describing and scientific argumentation. Defining the underlying constructs for appropriate statistical techniques. Describing and graphing data. Explaining and drawing inferences from data. Gaining real world experience using R to analyze data sets. Obtaining an understanding of ethical, social, political, and cultural issues confronted by those who perform statistical analyses. Understanding and critically assessing differing analytical methods.   FAQ Is the course content difficult? You’ve probably heard an answer like this before: At times some of the material can be dense. Well that isn’t much of a response. Difficulty is not the issue here since as humans with differing educational background, we will have strengths in some areas more than others. Instead the question is can you identify areas that need strengthened and communicate them? If you can, then you have a good shot at succeeding in this class.\n Is R difficult? Learning R can be especially challenging at first—it’s akin to learning a new language like Spanish or even mathematics. Even experienced R users get frustrated…and so much so that some of us have swear jars. However as silly as it sounds one of the best feelings is to overcome a roadblock. With that said, if you find yourself getting irritated, try the following: take a break, go let some frustration out, sleep, discuss with a peer, etc. If you are at your limit, take a few breaths and contact me!\n What if I’m a Visual/Aural/Read-write/Kinesthetic learner… You’re not one of those or even any of those. There’s not one accepted study that supports one type of learning style over another. In fact, there aren’t even any studies that support these four classifications either. You learn the best using multiple approaches. At one time I denoted multiple papers to support this, but recently a fantastic video was released and many of the sources I listed were also cited so enjoy this instead:\n    What if I find a mistake? Tell me! I strive to be error free but unfortunately like everyone else, make silly mistakes including grammar and spelling errors as well!\n  What are the course materials? There are four optional texts and two software packages necessary for this course. With that said, you will receive some supplementary materials in the course as well.\nTexts We’ll rely on the texts below:\n Frankfort-Nachmias, C. and Leon-Guerrero, A. (2020). Social Statistical for a Diverse Society (9th ed.). Sage.1\n American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.).\n  There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\n Software R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) statistical programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard — R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. Please note that\nyou do not need to have any programming experience to use R\n R is free, but it can sometimes be a task to install and configure. To make life easier, you can opt to use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser.\nThe service is convenient, but please keep in mind that it can be slow and is not designed to handle large data sets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also cannot customize much with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the term, you’ll want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and its always the tiny errors in your coding can result in tons of headache. People working in any syntax based software package at any level experience this!\nBut there are multiple resources both online and locally that are available. Please take a moment to go through this slideshow for a short description of the main outlets.\n   You can also use this link to view a larger version of slideshow in a new window or download it as a PDF.\nTo move back and forth, use ← and → and toggle fullscreen by pressing F. Just press O at any point in your slideshow and a display of all slides will appear. Click on a slide to go there or press O to exit. For more options, press H for help.\n  Assignments and Grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the tasks page.\n   Percent  Task  Location      10  R Training  Data Camp    10  Exploratory Data Analysis  Project    10  Homeworks  Tasks    20  Quizzes  In Class    25  Regular Exams  In Class    25  FinalExam2  In Class      \n   Grade  Range      A  \u0026gt; 90%    B  80%-89%    C  70–79%    D  60–69%    F  \u0026lt; 60%      Rmarkdown If you submit your work in Rmarkdown, you may earn up to an extra five percent on any task (this includes quizzes and exams that aren’t focused on R). Additionally in lieu of showing step by step work, you may submit R code instead. In these instances, both the code used and output must be presented but you still must provide a written or typed interpretation in context.3\n   Your Hours Please watch this video:\n   Your hours (formerly known as office hours) are set times dedicated to you the student!4). This means that I will be in my office or at home waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Zoom. You can request a meeting through either e-mail or Slack.\n Conduct and Expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that I came up with or stole from other professors:\n Late work: Barring the in-class tasks (e.g. exams, quizzes, etc.) and the project, past due deliverable will only be accepted up to 48 hours after the initial time and due date. For each full day an assignment is late, 10% of the final grade will be deducted. All submissions must be made via eCampus. There are no exceptions to this policy. Please note that I will not accept coursework by email or any other means.\n Participation: Please ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. Engagement is mostly defined by you — if that means commenting and answering questions - great; if it means sitting quietly and being focused - also great; but if it means being being disrespectful or flaking off - not so great.\n Justifications: On any submission, you must justify any assertion. I don’t know what you know so its your job to provide all of the necessary evidence to convince me that you do know what you say you know. While you’ve probably heard this multiple times over your life, think of it this way: if someone tells you that not only is the Earth flat, the core is actually made out of tiramisu and moscato, the first question you should be asking is what’s your evidence? possibly followed by is the core delicious?.\n Rubrics: While there are valid reasons for the utilization of a rubric in undergraduate classes, at the graduate level, I do not (often) provide nor use a such an item to guide or evaluate your submission due to four primary concerns:\nWhen writing anything in academia that is pivotal (a thesis, dissertation, journal article, report, etc.), a rubric isn’t often provided. If you write within the limitations as defined in a rubric, then creativity may be stifled (i.e. writing to the rubric rather than constructing a product from the ground up). Feedback can only be given along the criteria listed within a rubric which limits your learning as a student and constrains me as the instructor. Unless you are in a very specific area, the real world does not use rubrics!   Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. We’re all adults5.\n My philosophy:\nJust assume that all submissions are formal and must be submitted with the appropriate use of language, grammar, syntax, etc. and follow standard APA 7th edition formatting guidelines where applicable. People who live in a land of rainbows and ponies by being easily offended by content, believe their work to be flawless, or are generally unable to handle criticism should consider looking at another course. If you care about data, fieldwork, and learning a highly marketable skill set, then you’ve come to the right place. There is a great deal of content in this course and you will likely struggle with some at times. Given that, there is also something to be said about the satisfaction a person gets when figuring something out, but nowhere is it written that has to be on your own. You may find that a nudge here or there elicits the same feeling so please reach out for help.   Learning and knowledge during a pandemic When course objectives are written explicitly and clearly, they provide the information you need to figure out what a student should be able to do by the end of a given term. In fact, professors often test your proficiency in an area through multiple assessments such as exams, papers, presentations, etc where you are essentially asked to show us what you have learned. However learning is not the same as knowledge .\nTo save you from a long philosophical narrative on epistemology, in a nutshell we humans aren’t that good at evaluating a person’s knowledge mainly because its not a well-defined concept. With that said, we believe one indicator of knowledge is in a person’s ability to successfully explain a high level concept in such a way that the lay person can understand it. Every so often, consider asking yourself this:\nCan I describe whatever using conversational language so that a child could understand it?\n On top of what’s noted above and I’m not sure how to articulate this any better - life sucks right now! It is likely by now you know people who have been hospitalized or passed away, lost their jobs, and/or tested positive for COVID-19. Additionally stresses in life are up. Given this, here is my promise to you:\nIf you keep an open line, show initiative, and let me know ahead of time if something is going not according to plan6, I will do everything I can to help you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!\n   Course Policies Its pretty simple: Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat. Stay in touch. Be a good human.\n We will also follow WVU’s Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the term but things change and plans change. so deviations may become necessary as we move along during the term. Note that I reserve the right to alter or amend this syllabus and will send notifications if course tasks are affected.\nCOVID-19 statement WVU is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that this course will move to a fully online delivery format. If that occurs, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software.\nIn a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students, staff, and instructors to observe the social distancing and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines set by the University at all times. While in class, students will sit in assigned seats when applicable and wear the required PPE. Should a student forget to bring the required PPE, PPE will be available in the building for students to acquire. Students who fail to comply will be dismissed from the classroom for the class period and may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further sanctions.\nIf a student becomes sick or is required to quarantine during the semester, they should notify the instructor. The student should work with the instructor to develop a plan to receive the necessary course content, activities, and assessments to complete the course learning outcomes.\n Psychological and Psychiatric Services Life at WVU can be complicated and challenging, especially during a pandemic! You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Psychological and Psychiatric Services provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges.

Basically you can share what you like but don’t try to make a buck.\n Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) Effective teaching is a primary mission of West Virginia University. Student evaluation of instruction provides the university and the instructor with feedback about your experiences in the course for review and course improvement. Your participation in the evaluation of course instruction is both strongly encouraged and highly valued. Results are strictly confidential, anonymous, and not available to the instructor until after final grades are released by Admissions and Records. Information about how you can complete this evaluation will be provided later.\n University Attendance Policy At West Virginia University, class attendance contributes significantly to academic success. Students who attend classes regularly tend to earn higher grades and have higher passing rates in courses. Excessive absences may jeopardize students’ grades or even their ability to continue in their courses. There is a strong correlation between regular class attendance and academic success.\n Course Netiquette The basic premise is that the etiquette expected of students in the online environment is the same as that expected in a classroom. Common courtesy is the guiding rule of Internet communications. Be prepared to communicate effectively when taking an online course. Following these simple netiquette rules in your online class or education environment will ensure your success:\n Include a professional salutation. In this case, “Hello Dr. Roy” or “Dear Dr. Roy” is appropriate. Include a proper ending such as “Thank you” or “With regards.” Then type in your full name. Never type in ALL CAPS, because it reads as if you ARE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE. Act as professionally, via your writing, as you would in a face to face classroom. Refrain from inappropriate language and derogatory or personal attacks. Do not dominate any discussion. Give other students the opportunity to join in the discussion. Disagree with ideas but avoid challenges that may be interpreted as a personal attack. Check that you are replying to the specific person you intend, and not to the entire class. Never give your password to another person. Respect the virtual classroom. Never forward in-class communications or posts by others outside of this virtual space. Never spam your classmates. If you quote someone’s previous post, only quote enough to make your point.

When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention. Here’s a helpful guide to unzipping files on both macOS and Windows.\nUnzipping files on macOS Double click on the downloaded .zip file. macOS will automatically create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, and all the file’s contents will be inside. Double click on the RStudio Project file (.Rproj) to get started.\n Unzipping files on Windows tl;dr: Right click on the .zip file, select “Extract All…”, and work with the resulting unzipped folder.\nUnlike macOS, Windows does not automatically unzip things for you. If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file. Open the R Project file and RStudio will point to the correct working directory and everything will work.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6f4ecdc3d11db9e24e62ab87ff9e614d","permalink":"https://edp613.asocialdatascientist.com/resources/unzipping/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/unzipping/","section":"resources","summary":"Because RStudio projects typically consist of multiple files (R scripts, datasets, graphical output, etc.) the easiest way to distribute them to you for examples, assignments, and projects is to combine all the different files in to a single compressed collection called a zip file.","tags":null,"title":"Unzipping files","type":"docs"}]
